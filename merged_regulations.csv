Ninety years ago, the Reserve Bank of India was established to serve as the custodian of India's monetary and financial stability. Over these nine decades, we have evolved, adapting to the changing economic landscape while remaining committed to the economic progress of our nation and the welfare of its people. 4. As we entered the 90th year, exactly one year ago, we initiated the celebrations with the opening ceremony that was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister. Throughout the year, we organized several high-level events on themes such as emerging technologies and Digital Public Infrastructure. The Conference of Central Banks from the Global South reinforced India's thought leadership in the global community and deepened our understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. 5. To engage with the public, we hosted nationwide initiatives such as the RBI@90 Quiz, which received enthusiastic participation from students across the country. We organized an art competition that celebrated the creativity and heritage of India's artistic traditions. Sporting events, town hall meetings, tree plantation drives, and blood donation camps brought together our employees and communities. 6. All these events reinforced the spirit of collaboration and service that define the Reserve Bank. We celebrated our past and reaffirmed our responsibility for the future. We reflected on our achievements and rich legacy and recommitted ourselves to realising the vision of a Viksit Bharat built on a stronger, more stable, and inclusive financial system. 7. As we mark this milestone, we recognize that the Reserve Bank's role has expanded significantly beyond its initial mandate. Today, we stand at the confluence of tradition and transformation, where the imperatives of price stability, financial stability, and economic growth intersect with rapid technological advancements, global uncertainties, challenges of climate change and increasing public expectations. 8. The next decade will be crucial in shaping the financial architecture of our economy. We remain committed to expanding and deepening financial inclusion. We shall strive to foster a culture of continuous improvement in customer services and strengthening customer protection. It will be our endeavour to optimize our regulatory frameworks by balancing the interests of financial stability and efficiency. We will continue to support technology and innovation. We shall remain vigilant, adaptive, and forward-looking. We will continue to collaborate effectively with all stakeholders – governments and financial sector regulators, among others. We will do everything that is required to improve the financial system by expanding its access, enhancing its efficiency, and strengthening its resilience in an evolving economic landscape. 9. Even as we embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches, our core values - integrity, transparency, and commitment to public service - will continue to guide us. The trust that the people of India repose in the Reserve Bank is our greatest asset. We are determined to preserve it and further strengthen it in the years ahead. This institution belongs to the nation. We shall continue to take each and every decision, driven by an unwavering resolve to serve the interests of the people, the financial system, and the economy. 10. As we conclude this year-long celebration and step into our centenary decade, we do so with confidence, determination, and a clear vision. The journey ahead will demand continuous adaptation and agility; fresh thinking and innovation; collaboration and coordination; and an unwavering commitment to excellence and perfection. We, at the Reserve Bank, remain fully prepared to meet all challenges and seize all opportunities, to contribute proactively and vigourously, to India's economic progress. 11.

Chief General Manager Encl: As above MASTER CIRCULAR ON AGENCY COMMISSION Introduction 1. The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in . Government transactions eligible for agency commission 2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI: Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Governments Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments and Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for agency commission 3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India. Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur. 4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business. Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt. 5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e-mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work. 6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above. Government transactions not eligible for agency commission 7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission. 8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission. Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc. through agency banks by government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers. The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies/Municipalities/ companies/ Corporations/Local Bodies. Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies etc. Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government Ministry/Department (in consultation with CGA) or a State Government Department through any bank. Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on the mandate received from the governments. Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or State Government as ineligible for agency commission. 9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI from time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission and submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while claiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions. 10. Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI: After the operationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X7, agency banks authorised to collect Goods and Service Tax (GST), Customs and Central Excise Duties through ICEGATE, Direct Taxes under TIN 2.0 channel shall upload their luggage files in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on all days except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, all non-working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RBI for Government Transactions due to exigencies. It is to be ensured that these luggage files are uploaded in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on or before 1800 hours prescribed by Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs and Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Direct Taxes. No extension in cut-off time will be allowed to agency banks by RBI beyond 1800 hours for uploading of these luggage files in QPX/e-Kuber. 11. The date of monthly balance transfer for the State Government transactions is 5th of the following month. The State Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of previous month reported after 4th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned State government. 12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) or any adjustments thereof, if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of transaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned Ministry/Department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement. Rates for agency commission 13. As per agency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under: Sr. No. Type of Transaction Unit Revised Rate a. (i) Receipts - Physical mode Per transaction ₹40/- (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction ₹9/- b. Pension Payments Per transaction ₹75/- c. Payments other than Pension Per ₹100 turnover 6.5 paise per ₹100 14. In this context, the ‘Receipts-e-mode transactions’ indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter’s bank account through Internet banking as well as such transactions which do not involve physical receipt of cash /instruments at all. For example, challan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode. 15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017. 16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited. Therefore, records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission. 17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension transactions at the rate of ₹75 per transaction only when the entire work relating to disbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them. If the work relating to pension calculations etc. is attended to by the concerned Government Department / Treasury and the banks are required only to credit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under ‘other than pension payment’ and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 paise per ₹100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019. 18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should not exceed 14 per pensioner per year. This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits. 19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages. Where, however, the work is shared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the proportion of 75:25. Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency banks as detailed below: At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e., up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the Pay and Accounts Offices, and treasuries/sub-treasuries. At 75% of the applicable rate, where the dealing branch is required to account for the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank conducting government business. At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the scrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible for the accounting of these transactions and dispatching of the scrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc. 20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in certain cases. So also, for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of State government/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/Treasury. This new arrangement for settlement of State government funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018. Claiming agency commission 21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format (with GST details) to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State Government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt and transactions related to direct tax collection under TIN 2.0 regime, and transactions pertaining to collection of indirect taxes through ICEGATE reported to Mumbai Regional Office, RBI will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all authorized agency banks are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to the respective receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The agency commission claim for Central Government transactions reported to CAS, Nagpur, RBI will be continued to be settled at CAS, Nagpur, RBI. The formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in , and respectively. These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof. 22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, claims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank’s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit. 23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated November 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, centrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been replaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be. 24. For eligible Government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter. 25. However, for eligible Government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto. 26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate. Agency banks may also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate. Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims. 27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to Reserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions have been conducted. If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above, they may forward the same to RBI, only after giving reasons for delay. Penal interest for wrong claims 28. As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-compliance of instructions issued by Government or Reserve Bank shall attract imposition of penalty. Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.

RBI has issued certain instructions in this regard which is available in the . Clarifications, in the form of questions and answers, on certain issues related to the instructions issued by RBI is given below. 1. Whether a Joint Account can be continued for family pension after death of a pensioner? Yes, the banks should not insist on opening of a new account in case of Central Government pensioner if the spouse in whose favour an authorization for family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO) is the survivor. The family pension should be credited to the existing account without opening a new account by the family pensioner for this purpose. 2.

The pension paying banks credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by the Pension Paying Authorities. 3.

(b) Where excess pension payment has arisen on account of mistakes committed by the bank, the amount paid in excess should be refunded to the Government in lump-sum immediately after detection of the same and without waiting for recovery of any amount from the pensioners. 4. Should acknowledgement be given by pension paying banks while accepting Life Certificates from pensioners? There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also requested to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgements in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. 5. Is it possible to submit life certificates without visiting the branch? Yes, pensioners can submit life certificates without visiting the branch using Jeevan Praman provided the Pension Sanctioning Authority is on boarded on the platform. Further, banks have also been advised to provide super senior citizens (pensioners over 70 years of age) and differently abled or infirm persons (having medically certified chronic illness or disability) including those who are visually impaired, the facility to submit life certificate at the premises/ residence of such customers. 6.

Yes, instructions have been issued by RBI to pension disbursing banks to allow withdrawal of pension by following certain procedures which are given below: Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners (i) In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise such pensioners as under: (a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. (b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect / incapacity. (ii) With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under: (a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. (b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account. Agency banks have been asked to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board at the branches so that sick and disabled pensioners can make full use of these facilities. 7. How the payment of Dearness Relief at revised rate is to be paid to the pensioners? The pension paying agency banks have to revise the Dearness Relief based on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing the information from the website of the concerned governments, and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. 8. Whether a pensioner is entitled for any compensation from the agency banks for delayed credit of pension/ arrears of pension? Yes, pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment.

Chief General Manager Encl.: As above Master Circular – Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks Introduction Payment of pension to retired government employees, including payment of basic pension, increased dearness relief (DR), and other benefits, as and when announced by the governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by concerned Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till March 31, 2025 ( ). It does not replace or supersede any existing government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the past will continue to remain in operation subject to changes being made by the competent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarized hereunder. General Instructions Government orders on DR, etc. on websites 2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the procedure of forwarding related government orders in respect of dearness relief etc. to pension disbursing agency banks has been discontinued. Agency banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing from the government websites and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. Prompt implementation of Government’s instructions by agency banks 3. All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines/ instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI. Timing of pension disbursement by agency banks 4. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities. Refund of excess pension payment to Government 5. Whenever any excess/overpayment is detected, the entire amount thereof should be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately, when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is independent of recovery from the pensioner. Agency banks are requested to seek guidance from respective Pension Sanctioning Authorities regarding the process to be followed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any. 6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority’s acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank’s record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India. Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners 7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorize such pensioners as under: Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect /incapacity. 8. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under: Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account. 9. The pensioner may also be asked to indicate to the bank as to who would withdraw the pension amount from the bank on the basis of cheque/ withdrawal form as obtained above and that person should be identified by two independent witnesses. The person who would be actually drawing the money from the bank should be asked to furnish his signature to the bank. 10. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled pensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to strictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and sensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to the on pension disbursement hosted on our website ( ) in case of any doubt. Reimbursement of pension payments 11. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at Regional Office for Central / State Government pension payments respectively. Continuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner 12. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in case the spouse (family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO). Life Certificate- Issuance of Acknowledgement 13. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgments in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. Single Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments 14. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of reimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each pension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims. Customer Service 15. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum include the items given in . Agency banks may also instruct their internal auditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which may be made available to Reserve Bank’s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the branches. 16. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level, especially, after the setting up of Centralized Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular interaction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint one/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at monthly intervals. 17. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress complaints. 18. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing revised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised as under: Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment and the compensation shall be credited to the pensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in respect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008. Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain immediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authorities directly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the Reserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the Governments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself. When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feels disenfranchised. All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in all their dealings with the bank. Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details about pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners through the net or at the branches at periodic intervals, as may be deemed necessary and sufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements. All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payments must be accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business that there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular pension/arrears thereof. All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners who are of old age. Annex 1 Checklist relating to Government Business (pension related) for internal / concurrent audit Internal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner customers. In this regard, the following may be ensured: 1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for use during inspection of pension paying branches. 2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and enquire about their satisfaction with pension-related services. 3. A detailed checklist relating to pension payments/government business may be given by banks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of India, relating to pension payments/government business. These include the following: Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in dearness relief etc. Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of pensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of pensioners of all governments and departments exceeds affixed number, say, 100 or 200. Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts and the status is being indicated on the monthly pension slips issued to the pensioners. Whether pension accounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever applicable. Whether the bank branch has an effective complaint redressal mechanism, and the complaints of pensioners are attended promptly, and their grievances redressed expeditiously. Whether the pension is credited to pensioner’s account during the last four working days of the month except for the month of March for which pension is to be credited on or after first working day of April. Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Certificate/ Non-employment certificate/Employment Certificate from the pensioners in the month of November every year. Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension payments wherever applicable. Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably given by the tax collecting branches. Whether the challans are stamped giving bank’s BSR code and Challan Identification Number (CIN) clearly. Whether the stamped challans are kept in the custody of bank’s staff and handed over to the concerned taxpayer only on production of the paper token.

Such SRs shall be valued periodically by reckoning the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the ARC based on the recovery ratings received for such instruments. However, any unrealised gains recognised in the Profit and Loss Account on account of fair valuation of such investments shall be deducted from CET 1 capital, and no dividends shall be paid out of such unrealized gains. Any SRs outstanding after the final settlement of the government guarantee or the expiry of the guarantee period, whichever is earlier, shall be valued at one rupee (₹1). In the event of the SRs being converted to any other form of instruments as part of resolution, then the valuation and provisioning thereof, for such instruments shall be governed by the provisions as laid down under paragraph 19 of the Annex 1 to the . 3.

Foreign assets of Indian residents declined by US$ 40.1 billion and the claims of non-residents’ in India also declined by US$ 29.1 billion, resulting in increase in the India net foreign liabilities ( ).

The decline in Indian residents’ foreign assets during October-December 2024 was mainly on account of the decrease of US$ 70.1 billion in reserve assets.

Reserve assets, however, recorded an increase of US$ 13.2 billion over December 2023.

The fall in India’s foreign liabilities was due to the decline in inward direct and portfolio investments during the quarter, though trade credit, loans and currency & deposits recorded an increase.

Reserve assets accounted for 59.0 per cent of India’s total international financial assets in December 2024 ( ).

Variation in the exchange rate of rupee vis-a-vis other currencies impacted the change in liabilities, when valued in the US dollar terms.

The ratio of India’s international assets to international liabilities improved to 74.7 per cent in December 2024 from 73.1 per cent a year ago.

The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased to 53.6 per cent in December 2024 from 52.9 per cent a quarter ago and 51.2 per cent a year ago ( ). (Puneet Pancholy)

– Review of Interchange Fee and Customer Charges The Reserve Bank of India had, from time to time, issued various instructions on the number of free ATM transactions and maximum charges that can be levied on a customer beyond the mandatory free transactions. Instructions have also been issued by RBI on interchange fee structure for ATM transactions. Based on a review, it has been decided as under: The ATM interchange fee will be as decided by the ATM network. Customers are eligible for five free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-financial transactions) every month from their own bank ATMs. They are also eligible for free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-financial transactions) from other bank ATMs viz. three transactions in metro centres and five transactions in non-metro centres. Beyond the free transactions, a customer may be charged a maximum fee of ₹23 per transaction. This shall be effective from May 01, 2025. Applicable taxes, if any, shall be additionally payable. These instructions shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to transactions done at Cash Recycler Machines (other than for cash deposit transactions). 2.

Chapter II: Composition of Regulatory Capital 5. Minimum regulatory capital RRBs are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent on an ongoing basis. A bank shall compute CRAR in the following manner: Where, Total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) is calculated as the aggregate of RWAs and other off-balance sheet exposures, as mentioned in paragraph 7 below. 6.

Degrees of credit risk expressed as percentage weightings have been assigned to Balance Sheet assets and conversion factors to off-Balance Sheet items. Banks shall multiply the value of each asset/item by the relevant weights to produce risk-adjusted values of assets and of off-Balance Sheet items. The aggregate shall constitute the total RWAs to be taken into account for computing CRAR. The weights allotted to each category of Balance Sheet assets and off-Balance Sheet items are furnished in the . Chapter IV: Reporting 8.

[Paragraph 6.1.1(h)] Terms and Conditions applicable to Perpetual Debt Instruments to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital The Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) that may be issued as bonds or debentures by RRBs should meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital for capital adequacy purposes: 1. Terms of Issue of PDIs (a) Amount: RRBs shall issue PDI in Indian currency only. The amount of PDI to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks. (b) Paid-in Status: The instruments should be issued by the bank (i.e., not by any ‘SPV’ etc. set up by the bank for this purpose) and fully paid-in. (c) Limits: Within minimum Tier 1 of 7 percent, the PDIs will be limited to 1.5 per cent of the total RWAs. Any additional amount raised through PDIs over and above the 1.5 per cent of the RWAs will also be reckoned as Tier 1 capital provided the bank complies with the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent of RWAs before reckoning such additional amounts. (d) Maturity Period: The instruments shall be Perpetual i.e., there is no maturity date and there are no step-ups or other incentives to redeem. (e) Rate of Interest: (i) The interest payable to the investors shall be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate. (ii) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e., a coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banks’ credit standing. For this purpose, any reference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank’s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider banking sector will be treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. (f) Options: PDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or a 'step-up option'. However, RRBs may issue the instruments with a call option subject to strict compliance with each of the following conditions: (i) Call option shall be exercised only after the instrument has run for minimum five years; and (ii) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of RBI (Department of Regulation). While considering the proposals received from RRBs for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank’s CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option. (g) Lock-In Clause: (i) PDI should be subject to a lock-in clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall not be liable to pay interest, if (a) The bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. Or (b) The impact of such payment results in bank's capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR) falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. (ii) However, RRBs may pay interest with the prior approval of RBI, when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR remains above the regulatory norm. For this purpose, ‘Net Loss’ would mean either (a) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year; or (b) the loss incurred during the current financial year. (iii) The interest shall not be cumulative. (iv) All instances of invocation of the lock-in clause should be notified by the issuing banks to the Chief General Manager, Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India and Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai. (h) Seniority of Claim: The claims of the investors in PDI shall be: Senior to the claims of investors in equity shares; and Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors. (i) Discount: The PDIs shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual. (j) Other Conditions: (i) PDI should be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses. (ii) RRBs should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments. 2. Compliance with Reserve Requirements The total amount raised by a bank through PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements. 3. Reporting Requirements RRBs issuing PDI shall submit a report to Chief General Manager, Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai giving details of the debt raised, including the terms of issue specified at paragraph 1 above, together with a copy of the offer document, soon after the issue is completed. 4. Investment in PDIs (a) RRBs shall not invest in PDI issued by other banks including RRBs. (b) RRBs shall not issue PDI to retail investors/ FPI/ NRIs. 5. Grant of Advances against PDI RRBs should not grant advances against the security of the PDI issued by them. 6.

Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement 8.1 To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit at the district level, it was decided to rank districts on the basis of per capita credit flow to priority sector and build an incentive framework for districts with comparatively lower flow of credit and a dis-incentive framework for districts with comparatively higher flow of priority sector credit. With effect from FY 2024-25, a higher weight (125%) shall be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). The list of both categories of districts is given in and and will be valid up to FY 2026-27, subject to a review thereafter. The districts other than those mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will continue to have normal weightage of 100%. 8.2 The banks shall continue to report the actual outstanding amount in Quarterly Priority Sector Advances (QPSA) returns as hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI, based on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the ADEPT database. RRBs, UCBs, LABs and foreign banks (including Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) would be exempted from adjustments of weights in PSL achievement due to their currently limited area of operation/catering to a niche segment.

Since September 2010 the exercise has become mandatory for jurisdictions with systemically important financial sectors. Currently, it is mandatory for 32 jurisdictions including India, every five years, and for another 15 jurisdictions every ten years. Last FSAP for India was conducted in 2017 and the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was published by IMF on 21st December, 2017. 2. IMF released the latest India-FSSA report on their websites on February 28, 2025, based on the assessment carried out during 2024, while WB’s Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report is due for publication. 3. India welcomes assessment of the Indian financial system undertaken by the joint IMF-World Bank team conforming to the highest international standards. 4. IMF’s FSSA report highlights that India’s financial system has become more resilient and diverse since the last FSAP in 2017, driven by rapid economic growth. Financial Sector in India has shown recovery from various distress episodes of 2010s and withstood the pandemic well. In terms of evolution of financial sector landscape, Non-Banking Financial Intermediaries (NBFI) sector has become diverse but more interconnected. Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have sufficient aggregate capital to support moderate lending even in severe macrofinancial scenarios. 5. On regulation and supervision of NBFCs, IMF acknowledged India’s systematic approach for prudential requirements of NBFCs with scale based regulatory framework. IMF appreciated India’s approach on introduction of bank-like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for large NBFCs. For supervision of banks, IMF suggested strengthening credit risk management through IFSR 9 adoption and upgrading supervision over individual loans, collateral valuation, connected borrower groups, large exposure limits, and related-party transactions. 6. IMF acknowledges that the regulatory framework in securities markets has been enhanced in line with international practice to manage and prevent emerging risks. Notable improvements include establishing the Corporate Debt Market Development Fund (CDMDF), introducing swing pricing and liquidity requirements for bond mutual funds. The regulatory scope has also been expanded over emerging areas such as sustainability and investor protection measures for fast-growing equity derivatives products. 7. IMF has stated that public digital infrastructures have significantly improved retail financial inclusion and recommended that financially underserved sectors’ access to credit can be enhanced by strengthening legal, tax, and informational infrastructures for asset-based and digital lending. 8. The FSSA report acknowledges that India’s insurance sector is strong and growing, with a significant presence in both life and general insurance. The sector has remained stable, supported by better regulations and digital innovations. The report notes India’s progress in improving oversight, risk management and governance and suggests further steps toward riskbased solvency / supervision frameworks and stronger group supervision. It acknowledged transition plans towards risk-based approach in the insurance sector. This reflects India’s commitment to global best practices and a resilient insurance sector. 9. IMF recommends that financial stability should be the primary objective of the macroprudential authorities. 10. In terms of emerging risks, cybersecurity, climate change and system-wide contagion need attention. Financial stability risks from climate change appear manageable but warrant careful monitoring. The assessment suggested enhanced data coverage with better granularity for mapping climate-related financial risks. 11. IMF also analysed cyber security framework in banking sector, Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI), Critical Information Systems, and other relevant players in securities market. IMF found that Indian authorities have advanced cybersecurity risk oversight, especially for banks. However, IMF stated that extensive cybersecurity crisis simulations and stress tests for banks could be expanded for cross-sectoral and market-wide events to further strengthen cybersecurity resilience. 12. The recommendations in case of India FSAP are mainly focussed on bringing about further improvements in the structure and functioning of the financial system and many of the detailed recommendations are in conformity with the concerned authorities’/regulators’ own developmental plans. India remains committed to adoption of internationally accepted standards and best practices in a phased manner, attuned to domestic needs and economic conditions, wherever necessary.

The Bulletin includes four speeches, five articles and current statistics. The five articles are: ; ; ; ; and . I. State of the Economy The resilience of the global economy is being tested by escalating trade tensions and a heightened wave of uncertainty around the scope, timing, and intensity of tariffs. While engendering heightened volatility in global financial markets, these have also caused apprehensions about the slowdown in global growth. Amidst these challenges, the Indian economy continues to demonstrate resilience as evident in the robust performance of the agriculture sector and improving consumption. The reverberations of a tumultuous external environment, however, are being reflected in sustained foreign portfolio outflows. India’s macroeconomic strength to face these challenges is bolstered by a decline in headline CPI inflation to a seven-month low of 3.6 per cent in February 2025 on account of a further correction in food prices. II. Spatial Distribution of Monsoon and Agricultural Production By Abhinav Narayanan and Harendra Kumar Behera This article analyses the impact of spatial variation of rainfall across districts on production of Kharif crops. It also examines how deficient or excess rainfall during specific periods impact the production of specific crops. Highlights: Extreme weather events such as excessive or insufficient rainfall cause significant crop damages leading to disruptions in production resulting in reduced yields or lower quality of produce.

The timing of extreme weather events is crucial, as crop production cycles vary.

Insufficient rainfall in the months of June and July negatively impacts cereal and pulses production, while oilseeds are particularly vulnerable to excessive rainfall during the harvesting period (August-September). III. Changing Dynamics of India’s Remittances – Insights from the Sixth Round of India’s Remittances Survey By Dhirendra Gajbhiye, Sujata Kundu, Alisha George, Omkar Vinherkar, Yusra Anees, Jithin Baby This article analyses the results of the sixth round of India’s remittances survey conducted for 2023-24. It captures various dimensions of inward remittances to India – country-wise source of remittances, state-wise destination of remittances, transaction-wise size of remittances, prevalent mode of transmission, cost of sending remittances and share of remittances transmitted through the digital modes vis-à-vis cash. Highlights: India’s inward remittances have more than doubled during 2010-11 to 2023-24 and have been a stable source of external financing during this period. Following a pandemic-led contraction during 2020-21, remittances to India in the post pandemic period recorded a significant surge.

The survey results indicate that the share of inward remittances from advanced economies has risen, surpassing the share of Gulf economies in 2023-24, reflecting a shift in migration pattern towards skilled Indian diaspora.

Maharashtra, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, continue to be the dominant recipient of remittances.

The cost of sending remittances to India has moderated significantly, driven by digitalisation, but remains higher than the SDG target of 3 per cent.

Additionally, on an average, 73.5 per cent of total remittances received by the money transfer operators in 2023-24 were through digital mode.

Furthermore, fintech companies offer affordable cross-border remittance services, fostering competition among different remittance service providers. IV. Decoupling Economic Growth from Emissions: A LMDI Decomposition Analysis By Madhuresh Kumar, Shobhit Goel, Manu Sharma, Muskan Garg This article examines the drivers behind India's CO₂ emissions growth from 2012 to 2022 using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. It breaks down total emissions into key contributing factors, including the impact of GDP growth (activity effect), improvements in energy efficiency (energy intensity effect), shifts in the economic structure (structural effect), changes in the composition of fuel (fuel mix effect), and the growing share of renewable energy in electricity generation, which reduces the carbon intensity of electricity (emission factor effect). Highlights: During 2012-22, energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 706 million tons. The main contributor was economic growth (+1073 Mt), with a smaller impact from the change in fuel mix of the economy (+78 Mt). However, gains in energy efficiency (-399 Mt), structural changes (-15 Mt), and improvements in emission intensity of electricity due to increased use of renewables (-30 Mt) helped curb emissions.

India's energy efficiency improved by 1.9 per cent annually, exceeding the global average.

India's growth decoupled from emissions, with a decoupling elasticity of 0.59, comparable to other lower-middle-income countries.

Renewables have had a small but significant impact on emission reduction over the past decade, with solar and wind accounting for 2.1 percent of total primary energy in 2022-23.

Going ahead, the emission factor effect is expected to play a more prominent role as renewables increasingly replace fossil fuels and green hydrogen usage expands in industries. V. Market Access and IMF Arrangements: Evidence from Across the Globe By Shruti Joshi and PSS Vidyasagar The article analyses loans availed by various countries from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during 2000-2023 and finds a negative relation between market access and dependence on IMF’s loan for those countries which resorted to IMF loans. Highlights: During 2000-2023, dependence of Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) on IMF resources increased on account of their limited access to international financial markets and alternate sources of funding. Several fast growing large EMDEs, including India and China, however, did not have to take recourse to the IMF loans.

During the crisis periods, especially the Global Financial Crisis and Euro-Zone Crisis, some Advanced Economies also resorted to IMF loans due to their reduced market access on account of sovereign rating downgrades.

Among countries that resorted to IMF loans, those which faced a larger country risk premium availed larger funding.

Access to alternative sources of funding such as Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) and swap lines reduces the dependence on IMF loans. The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. (Puneet Pancholy)

The MoU was signed by the Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Shri Sanjay Malhotra and the Governor, Bank of Mauritius, Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen G.C.S.K. The MoU documents were exchanged in Port Louis, Mauritius in the presence of the Honourable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the Honourable Prime Minister of Mauritius, Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025. 2. The MoU aims to promote the use of INR and MUR in bilateral trade. The MoU covers all current account transactions and permissible capital account transactions as agreed upon by both the countries. This framework would enable exporters and importers to invoice and pay in their respective domestic currencies, which in turn, would enable the development of a market in the INR-MUR pair. Use of local currencies would optimise costs and settlement time for transactions. 3. This collaboration marks a key milestone in strengthening bilateral cooperation between RBI and BOM. Use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Mauritius as well as deepen financial integration and strengthen the historical, cultural, and economic relations between India and Mauritius.

Shri Sanjay Malhotra, Governor, inaugurated the Conference in the presence of the Deputy Governor, Shri Swaminathan J., Executive Directors of RBI and participants of the conference.

The Governor, in his , highlighted the significant strides in improving banking services over the years. He, however, emphasised the need for significantly enhancing customer experience so as to obviate any need for grievance redressal. He exhorted the Regulated Entities to strengthen their internal grievance redress framework to effectively address grievances at their level and avoid escalation of grievances to the RBI ombudsman. He also highlighted the need for improving the KYC processes and raising customer awareness, specially about digital frauds.

Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, professor, IIT Bombay and Chair of RBI’s Committee on FREE-AI, delivered the keynote address in which he highlighted the role of Large Language Models in developing efficient and scalable systems, especially in the area of customer service and grievance redress. He also underscored the potential risks and challenges in adoption of AI and emphasized the importance of responsible AI.

The Conference also had panel discussions on grievance resolution through technological transformation and adoption of a synergetic approach for strengthening customer protection.

The Reserve Bank has been organising this conference on or around the World Consumer Rights Day, that is, 15th March. World Consumer Rights Day is celebrated every year with the aim of raising global awareness about consumer rights and needs. We organise this conference to reflect on our achievements with regard to consumer services and to deliberate on how to improve services and reduce grievances. We need to improve consumer services, not only because it is our duty to do so, but because it is in our selfish interest to do so. In this age of competition, we would not survive long if we do not provide quality service to our consumers.

2. We have made tremendous strides in improving consumer services over the years. We have enabled internet banking and mobile banking. Most of the banking services, be it opening a deposit account, or taking a small loan have been digitised, adding to the convenience and speed. We are making record number of digital transactions through UPI and other means of digital payments. Many among the younger generation may have never visited a bank branch. We have even enabled opening of accounts using video KYC.

3. While we have enhanced customer experience over the years, the high number of customer grievances continues to be a matter of serious concern. I am told that last year (2023-24), the 95 Scheduled Commercial Banks alone received over 10 million complaints from their customers. If we take into account the complaints received at other RBI-regulated entities (REs), the number would be even higher. One may argue that this amounts to only four complaints per thousand accounts per year as there are about 2.5 billion bank accounts. But, for us, even one complaint is a cause of concern. We have 10 million complaints and with the rapidly growing customer base and expanding suite of products, this may grow, if we do not get our act together.

Customer satisfaction – a cornerstone for banking and other financial services

4. Excellent customer service, in fact excellent customer experience is a sine qua non in any service industry. Our effort should be to enhance the total customer experience. The experience should be such that there is no cause for a grievance that requires a redress. Let me state a fundamental truth: every complaint is a test of trust. When a consumer files a grievance – whether for a disputed transaction, a lapse in service, inappropriate pricing or charges or an unfair practice – it is a signal that our system has fallen short. Left unresolved, such issues can erode consumer confidence and tarnish the entire ecosystem.

5. I am reminded of a real story about customer service. Some of you, especially the management graduates, may have heard it but it is so appropriate for today’s theme that it is worth being retold. In the winter of 1975, in a town in Alaska, a man walked into a store and complained to the salesman present that the snow tyres that he bought some time ago were not holding. The salesman was a little puzzled. He said that he could not replace them but will check what he could do and went to the back of the store. Those of you, who have visited departmental stores in the USA, would know that refunds are processed at the back of the store. The salesman came back after some time and handed over some cash as refund and the customer left satisfied. Can anyone guess why this was unique, as no questions asked policy for refunds is fairly common in the USA? It is because the company in question is Nordstrom which does not even sell tyres. It sells apparel and shoes. But, for Nordstrom, customer comes first. Trusting him and winning his trust is more important than anything else.

6. Some say that this is not a true story. How is this possible? How could a company offer refund for a product which it never sold? Nordstrom, however, insists that this incident did take place. Nordstrom had acquired three stores from another company that sold miscellaneous articles including tyres. The customer did not realise that the store had changed and walked in with his complaint. The key message is that Nordstrom saw itself being in the business of customer service, and not just selling goods. We too need to realise that we are in the business of providing unalloyed customer service and not just selling banking and other financial services.

Top management to accord priority to customer service

7. I am sure you will all agree that we are indeed in the business of customer service. However, I suspect that we are not spending enough time on customer service and grievance redressal as a result of which not only are there a large number of complaints being received by banks and NBFCs but in the absence of satisfactory resolution, a large number of them are getting escalated to RBI Ombudsmen.

8. Let me give you some perspective. The number of complaints received under RBI's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme increased at a compounded average growth rate of almost 50 per cent per year over last two years to 9.34 lakh in 2023-24. The number of complaints processed at the Office of RBI Ombudsman increased by 25 per cent from about 2,35,000 in 2022-23 to almost 2,94,000 in 2023-24. Not only are large number of complaints getting escalated, a large proportion of them – nearly 57 per cent of the maintainable complaints last year – required mediation or formal intervention by the RBI Ombudsmen. You would all agree that this is a highly unsatisfactory situation and needs our urgent attention.

9. I would, therefore, strongly urge all the MD&CEOs, Zonal and Regional Managers and the Branch Managers to spend some time every week, if not every day on grievance redressal. This is a must. All great CEOs find time to do it. We too must keep some time in our diary for improving customer service and grievance redressal.

Improving customer service systems

10. Customer complaints aren’t a nuisance – they are in fact opportunities to improve, innovate, and build trust. Handling them well can define your success. Each unresolved grievance is a missed opportunity for regulated entities to reaffirm customer trust and loyalty. It is also a warning signal as repeat complaints are often signs of systemic flaws. Today, complaints often surface on social media even before reaching official channels, highlighting the need for proactive measures.

11. The effort thus should be to not only resolve the complaints but also to ensure that the same type of complaint does not arise again. Many of the complaints like digital transaction disputes, unauthorized charges, or miscommunication frequently recur. These are clearcut symptoms of underlying issues in the overall customer service framework of the regulated entities. A thorough root cause analysis should be performed for each complaint so as to enable remedial action and avoid repetition of same type of complaint.

12. In fact, I would go a step further. Best service is not one in which there is no occasion for grievance redressal but one in which there is no occasion for the customer service department to step in. Systems should work seamlessly and conveniently so that customers do not have to call the branch or the customer service centre or talk to anyone in the Bank or NBFC. Systems have to be so user-friendly that customers can rely on self-service rather than being dependent on anyone else.

Improving internal grievance redressal systems

13. While improving systems to reduce grievances is important, setting up a robust grievance redressal system is equally important for all regulated entities. I would urge you all to review the same. While the regulations do not make any prescription for the organisational structure for grievance redressal, my experience suggests that there should be at least two levels for grievance redressal in large REs, with unresolved grievances getting escalated from the lower to the higher level. The highest level should be at a fairly high rank. This to ensure that requests do not get rejected without having been examined by a senior functionary who is empowered to take decisions in consumer interest. This will help reduce grievances getting escalated to the Ombudsman. It must also be ensured that there are sufficient number of grievance redress officers at all levels including in the Internal Ombudsman office.

14. I would also like to draw your attention to the misclassification of complaints as requests, queries, and disputes by the regulated entities. This results in the complainants’ grievances remaining unaddressed. Moreover, this is also a gross regulatory violation.

Major areas of service improvement

15. Let me now briefly allude to some of the major areas where we need to improve. These relate to KYC, digital frauds, mis-selling, and aggressive recovery practices.

16. As for KYC, we need to ensure that once a customer has submitted documents to a financial institution, we do not insist on obtaining the same documents again. Once the customer has updated his details, for example, his residential address, with one regulated entity of any financial sector regulator, it gets updated in CKYCR and other REs are notified of the updation. PML Rules made by the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance and RBI’s Master Directions on KYC mandate regulated entities to check the CKYCR system before seeking KYC documents for opening an account. However, most banks and NBFCs have not enabled the same in their branches/business outlets, causing avoidable inconvenience to customers. This may be facilitated early. This will be in the interest of all.

17. Another important issue connected to customer protection is rising digital frauds. It is a matter of great concern that innocent customers continue to fall prey to scamsters. While this could be attributed to rise in digital transactions and innovative methods adopted by fraudsters, lack of customer awareness is also a major reason for the same. To mitigate this menace, REs not only need to put in place robust internal controls but also enhance digital financial literacy.

18. The issues of mis-selling and aggressive recovery practices have been highlighted earlier too. In this context too, I would request you to keep consumer interest supreme.

Embracing technology – the AI way

19. Let me now come to the theme of this year’s conference: AI’s potential to revolutionize grievance redressal. We are entering an exciting era where technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), can drive remarkable improvements in speed, accuracy, and fairness of complaint resolution.

20. AI can help categorize incoming complaints by urgency, complexity, or subject area, ensuring minimal delay in reaching the right people or the right team. AI can also help in optimising complaint routing. Further, it can assist in decision-making and reducing processing time.

21. Secondly, AI can be used to pinpoint systemic gaps by analysing both structured and unstructured data such as emails, chat logs, and call transcripts. This will aid in identifying training needs and guiding necessary process reforms. Using data from millions of consumer branch visits, call centre logs, mobile apps, and social media, a unified, AI-driven view of all these interactions can help identify common pain points more efficiently. Leveraging data analytics, sentiment analysis, and predictive models, AI can be used to analyse large volumes of data to detect spikes in issues – such as ATM failures or erroneous charges – and alert REs pre-emptively.

22. Lastly, in a linguistically diverse country like India, AI-driven chatbots and voice recognition tools can eliminate language barriers by operating in local languages. Moreover, the implementation of conversational AI in chatbots, voicebots, and advanced IVR systems can handle routine queries round the clock, thereby freeing people to focus on cases that require empathy and complex problem-solving.

23. In short, integrating AI at every stage – from complaint lodging to closure – can result in a seamless, efficient, and data-driven grievance redressal system. Such a framework not only reduces processing times and addresses repetitive complaints but also fosters equitable outcomes by mitigating human biases. It is time that the banking industry explores and pioneers the integration of technology – including AI – to strengthen the grievance resolution mechanisms and make it best in class across the globe.

Challenges and guardrails in AI driven grievance redressal system

24. While AI presents unparalleled opportunities, we need to be cognizant of the challenges and risks that its adoption poses. There are concerns on data privacy, algorithmic bias and complexity in AI-driven models. As we embrace AI in grievance redressal or any other process, we must also remain mindful of ethical considerations. Human oversight, bias mitigation and data privacy must be integrated into the AI Systems to ensure transparent and consistent outcomes.

Investing in human resources

25. While technology in all its forms is a powerful enabler, I would like to emphasise that it is no substitute for integrity, empathy, and human judgment. In a world increasingly driven by data, algorithms, and automation, it is all too easy to lose sight of the human element. Every transaction represents not just a number in a ledger, but the hard-earned savings of a family, the dreams of a small entrepreneur, or the lifelong savings of a senior citizen. It is, therefore, critical that REs continue to invest in human resources dedicated for customer service and grievance redressal. It is essential to invest in training of staff, especially in behavioural aspects of customer service. Moreover, the staff needs to be empowered to take decisions based on their judgement to redress consumer grievances, enhance customer satisfaction and win consumer trust.

RBI as a facilitator

26. In the end, I would like to assure you that, while we exhort you to provide services efficiently to customers, we in the Reserve Bank shall also provide various services, approvals, clarifications, etc. to the regulated entities in a timely manner. We already have a citizen’s charter. We are in the process of reviewing the charter. We will make the charter comprehensive to include all services that we offer either to the REs or directly to citizens. Moreover, we are reviewing the timelines for each service. It will be our endeavour to provide all approvals, etc. within the timelines. We are also making mandatory the use of PRAVAAH, which is RBI’s secure and centralised web-based portal for any individual or entity to seek authorisation, license or regulatory approval on any reference made to the Reserve Bank in a timely manner. This will help us in expediting the disposal of applications received by the Reserve Bank.

Conclusion

27. We stand at a pivotal juncture as India looks to realise its dream of a more resilient and inclusive Viksit Bharat. With the financial sector touching the lives of almost the entire population, we have a critical role. To succeed in this role, we must continue to enhance customer service and customer protection.

I would not dwell in detail about the perils of climate change since this audience is already well aware about its impact not only on the real economy, but also the financial system, as well as our day-to-day lives. Climate related changes are perceptible, clear, and visible. They are intensifying and threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and economies. It is our individual and collective responsibility, to work together effectively and contribute to the global efforts to mitigate the risks associated with climate change and ensure that the Indian financial system remains resilient. Dimensions of Climate Change Risks 2. There are two dimensions to climate change related risks that we as regulators, policymakers and practitioners have to be aware of – the first is facilitative involving capacity building, development of the ecosystem and financing of green and sustainable transition; and the second is the prudential aspect, which is related to risk management. 3. While the role of the Central Banks in managing risks posed by climate change to the financial system is increasingly being recognised, their role in facilitating the financing of green and sustainable transition has been a matter of debate and has varying dimensions to it. Central Banks in Advanced Economies have traditionally followed an asset neutral approach. Central Banks in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), on the other hand, have adopted directed lending policies to channelise credit to certain sectors of their economies given their individual country circumstances and developmental objectives. In the Indian context, as you are all aware, the priority sector lending guidelines facilitate credit to be channelled to specific sectors including renewable energy. 4. On the prudential aspect, there are several channels through which climate change risks impact the financial system. All the major types of financial risks - be it credit, market, or operational risk - are influenced by climate change. These risks include losses from credit portfolio due to extreme climate events or natural disasters (physical risks) and loss in value of collaterals due to stranded assets (transition risks); losses from investments; and operational losses. Although climate change impacts almost all economic sectors, the extent and nature of these risks vary by sector, industry, geography, and institution. The mitigation of climate change risks, therefore, rests – firstly, on realistic and comprehensive assessment of the frequency and severity of climate risks and secondly, estimating their financial impact, which is no easy task. 5. As a Central Bank, the Reserve Bank is mindful of its role in addressing and mitigating risks to the financial system from climate change. In this context, our endeavour has been to play the role of a facilitator – including supporting capacity building and fostering a conducive regulatory framework for promoting green and sustainable finance. One important aspect of green financing/lending for sustainable finance is the higher credit risk due to borrowers’ use of new and emerging green technologies, which have relatively limited track record in terms of reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Regulated Entities, therefore, need to develop suitable capacity and technical know-how to better appraise risks in financing projects which use such green technologies. Evolution of climate change risks and mitigation for the Indian Financial System. 6. The Reserve Bank’s approach with respect to climate related financial risks is oriented not just for the short-term but also the medium-term, taking into consideration the evolving national and global circumstances. Over the short-term, our goal is to be able to make a realistic estimation of the impact of climate related risks not just on individual institutions but also on the financial system as a whole. This would involve scenario analysis and stress testing exercises, using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. 7. The risk management framework in Regulated Entities for climate related financial risks is still evolving. There is a need for concerted efforts in developing the risk management framework; building technical expertise and competencies for comprehensive assessment and mitigation of climate related financial risks as also on the extent of losses due to such risks. I would now like to highlight some of the initiatives of the Reserve Bank has taken in this regard. 8. Climate related financial risk modelling is very important and data intensive. There is limited data available for measuring financial impact of climate change. Moreover, there is lack of benchmark sectoral transition pathways and country-specific carbon emission database. These constraints limit our ability to make a comprehensive assessment of climate change risks. These limitations also constrain comparison of financial impact, as each Regulated Entity may use its own assumptions and models to process climate related data. To address such constraints, we had in October last year announced the creation of a repository called the Reserve Bank – Climate Risk Information System (RB-CRIS). The repository is intended to bridge data gaps by providing standardised datasets. These datasets include hazard data, vulnerability data and exposure data related to physical risk assessment, sectoral transition pathways and carbon emission intensity database related to transition risk assessment. Work on this repository is underway and we expect to launch it later this year. 9. Several jurisdictions have started work on the assessment and disclosure of climate related risks. International organisations such as International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation has released standards on climate related disclosures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has also released a consultative document on disclosure of climate-related financial risks with a view to integrate climate risk related disclosures under the Pillar III disclosure requirements of the Basel framework. The Reserve Bank, as you are aware, had already issued draft guidelines on Disclosure Framework on Climate related Financial risks in February 2024, for public comments. We have received valuable feedback and are in the process of finalising the guidelines. A guidance note on Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing is also being developed for the Regulated Entities. 10. As we all are aware, technology and finance have a critical role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. There is a need to build innovative solutions and capabilities in these areas. The Reserve Bank has been encouraging and facilitating innovations through its Regulatory Sandbox and Hackathon initiatives in the Fintech space. We propose to set up a dedicated “on Tap” cohort on climate change risks and sustainable finance under RBI’s Regulatory Sandbox initiative. We are also planning to conduct a special “Greenathon” on climate change and related aspects. 11. We had in April 2023, issued the Framework on acceptance of Green Deposits with the objective of enabling banks to augment the flow of credit to green activities and projects. This again shows our willingness to facilitate financing green/sustainable projects. The idea behind the Green Deposits is similar to that of sovereign green bonds. We all need to raise awareness about such products. 12. I would like to highlight an important initiative to promote green finance. We have included finance to small renewable energy projects – solar, biomass based, windmills, micro-hydel plants and non-conventional energy based public utilities viz. street lighting systems, and remote village electrification projects as part of priority sector lending. 13. One of the oft-cited constraints to adequate flow of climate related finance has been the lack of bankable projects. Capacity and expertise constraints limit the ability to appraise and thus finance climate change mitigation. It also enhances the risk of funding such projects. Thus, creation of a common pool of such bankable projects will have multi-fold benefits for the entire ecosystem. Regulated Entities with experience of such projects can contribute to the pool for the benefit of others, while also benefiting from such information shared by other Regulated Entities. This will help share knowledge for benefit of all. There is a need for collaboration in this emerging and evolving area. I urge the Regulated Entities to seriously consider setting up such a pool through an appropriate institutional arrangement. 14. Before I conclude, let me say what is perhaps obvious. The impact of climate change risks is not limited to the financial system alone but extends to the real economy. Be it the corporates or the MSMEs or the agricultural sector, climate change risks are ubiquitous. This calls for a cohesive co-ordination and harmonisation in approach, among not only the financial sector regulators and the Regulated Entities but also various government agencies. There is a need to adopt a holistic approach towards mitigation of climate change risks considering the country specific requirements and circumstances. We will collaborate and coordinate with the government and other regulators to ensure that there is harmonisation and consistency in rules, regulations and our approach towards mitigating the impacts of climate change. 15. I am happy to note that while we are deliberating on this important topic, the Annual Steering Committee meeting of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is also taking place today at this venue. NGFS is doing some pioneering work in the area of managing climate related financial risks. Be it the NGFS scenarios, the recent work on adaptation, or the work on data directory, they have been a source of technical guidance and capacity building across the globe. We look forward to continued engagement and coordination with the NGFS. Conclusion 16. To conclude, let me reiterate that climate change risks are real and all stakeholders need to be prepared to address the risks and challenges from climate change. Even though we have made a decent start, there are still issues that need to be addressed. The Reserve Bank remains committed to continue adopting a constructive and consultative approach towards supporting the various initiatives being undertaken towards management and mitigation of financial risks related to climate change. We will continue to work steadfastly to realise our vision to build a financial system that can not only withstand future climate shocks, but also actively contribute to India’s journey towards a sustainable and resilient future. I urge you all to contribute towards this cause. As Albert Einstein had said “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.” Let me also take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to you and your families on the occasion of Holi - the festival of colours.

Investing is an important tool for individuals and families in achieving their financial goals, such as affording higher education, supporting retirement, or simply building wealth for the future. While building for their own financial future, investors are also playing a key role in powering the innovation-based U.S. economy by providing capital to businesses of all sizes.

“Financial Literacy Month provides an excellent opportunity to highlight the importance of investors saving and investing for their financial future. From stocks, bonds, and funds to newer products in the marketplace, investing ultimately supports our nation’s overall economy,” said Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. “All investors have an opportunity to reach their personal financial goals while also playing a role in capital formation, which makes our economy so dynamic.”

During the month of April, SEC regional and headquarters staff will encourage investors to take advantage of the free saving and investing tools and resources available on Investor.gov. OIEA’s “Ten Investment Tips for 2025 Investor Bulletin” provides investors with information on how to avoid investment scams, the importance of diversification, how to be an informed investor, and more. Investors can also test their investing knowledge by taking April’s Financial Literacy Month Quiz.

As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in August 2020 and June 2021, Randy Miller’s nonprofit company, Legacy Cares, issued approximately $284 million in municipal bonds through an Arizona state entity to finance the construction of a multi-sports park and family entertainment center in Mesa, Arizona. Investors were to be paid from revenue from the sports complex, and investors were given financial projections for revenue that were multiple times the amount needed to cover payments to investors, according to the complaint. However, the complaint alleges that the defendants fabricated or altered documents forming the basis for those revenue projections, including letters of intent and contracts with sports clubs, leagues, and other entities to use the sports complex. The sports complex opened in January 2022 with far fewer events and much lower attendance and generated tens of millions less in revenue than expected under the false projections, and the bonds defaulted in October 2022, according to the complaint.

“As our complaint alleges, these defendants used fake documents to deceive municipal bond investors into believing a sports complex would generate more than enough revenue to make payments to bondholders,” said Antonia Apps, Acting Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. “Maintaining the integrity of the approximately $4 trillion municipal bond market is critical for local governments and investors alike. The SEC will hold accountable individuals who defraud municipal bond investors.”

The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Randy Miller, Chad Miller, and De Laveaga with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges for similar conduct.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by William T. Salzmann, Jonathan Grant, Joseph Chimienti, and Creighton Papier and supervised by David Zhou and Rebecca Olsen of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. They were assisted by Steven Varholik of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jason Bussey of the San Francisco Regional Office, Mr. Salzmann, and Mr. Grant.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges against David Yow Shang Chiueh of East Hanover, New Jersey and his investment advisory firm, Upright Financial Corp., for misconduct and for investing more than 25 percent of Upright Growth Fund’s assets in a single company over multiple years, causing losses of $1.6 million.

In November 2021, Chiueh and Upright settled SEC charges that they, as investment advisers to Upright Growth Fund, violated its policy by investing more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry between July 2017 and June 2020, committing fraud and breaching their fiduciary duties. Despite being ordered to stop this conduct, the SEC’s complaint alleges, the defendants continued their fraud by violating the 25 percent industry concentration limit and making misrepresentations about it between at least November 24, 2021, and June 23, 2024. As a result, the complaint alleges that the defendants’ decision to wait more than two-and-a-half years to sell the relevant stock resulted in losses of approximately $1.6 million to the fund and its investors.

Additionally, the SEC’s complaint alleges the defendants engaged in further misconduct during this same period when Chiueh operated the fund’s board without the required number of independent trustees and misrepresented the independence of one in filings. The defendants also failed to provide or withheld key information from the board, according to the complaint, and they hired an accountant for the fund without the required vote by the board.

“As alleged, the defendants not only ran the fund contrary to its fundamental investment policies, but they actively misled investors and the fund’s board about their conduct,” said Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit. “Undeterred by their prior SEC settlement involving these very same issues, we allege that the defendants repeatedly violated fundamental rules designed to protect investors in mutual funds.”

The SEC’s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, including provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Stephen Holden and Ming Ming Yang, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Mr. Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit, as well as Debra Jaroslawicz, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office.

Boomer, and its former chief operating officer and partner Tiffany L. Hawkins, for breaches by Boomer and Hawkins of their fiduciary duties when they misused fund and portfolio company assets.

According to the SEC’s orders, from at least August 2021 through February 2024, Hawkins misappropriated approximately $223,000 from portfolio companies of a private fund she managed with Boomer and that was advised by Momentum Advisors. Specifically, Hawkins misused portfolio company debit cards in more than 100 transactions to pay for vacations, clothing, and other personal expenses, and caused herself to be paid compensation in excess of her authorized salary. As set forth in the orders, Hawkins concealed her misconduct from Momentum Advisors, from the portfolio companies’ bookkeeper, and from SEC staff, and Boomer failed to reasonably supervise Hawkins despite red flags of her misappropriation. The order against Boomer also finds that he caused the fund to pay a business debt that should have been paid by an entity he and Hawkins controlled, resulting in an unearned benefit to the entity of $346,904, and that Momentum Advisors failed to adopt and implement adequate policies and procedures and to have the fund audited as required.

“As the orders find, Hawkins and Boomer breached their fiduciary duties and misused fund and portfolio company assets for their own benefit, all to the detriment of their clients,” said Thomas P. Smith, Jr., Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office.

The orders find that Hawkins and Boomer violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that Momentum Advisors violated the compliance and custody rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Hawkins, Boomer, and Momentum Advisors consented to the entry of cease-and-desist orders. Additionally, Hawkins agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty and to be subject to an associational bar; Boomer agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be subject to a 12-month supervisory suspension; and Momentum Advisors agreed to a censure and to pay a $235,000 civil penalty.

As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in late 2021, Butkus, under the alias Darius Karpavicius, operated fictitious investment firms TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group and offered investors shares in sham mutual funds through the firms’ websites, a press release, and internet advertisements, all of which made numerous materially false and misleading statements. According to the complaint, these websites and other materials falsely stated, among other things, that the TBO Capital and Gray Capital mutual funds were managed by industry professionals with decades of experience and achieved years of high-yield investment returns. In reality, the complaint alleges, the managers did not exist, their biographies were fake, and TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group never made any investments. Rather, as alleged, the entire operation was a fraud run by Butkus to enrich himself. Butkus allegedly used some of the investors' money to operate his fraudulent scheme, but stole most for his personal benefit, such as dining at restaurants, cash withdrawals, and crypto asset purchases.

“Butkus’ conduct was egregious: He went to great lengths to defraud unsuspecting investors using sophisticated websites, internet advertisements, and an alias complete with a doctored passport,” said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “This case underscores the SEC’s unwavering commitment to hold individuals accountable for engaging in fraud that harms retail investors.”

The SEC is refiling this action, which it voluntarily dismissed on January 11, 2024, against Butkus’s alias, “Darius Karpavicius,” through a dismissal without prejudice.

The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Butkus, HMC Trading LLC, and HMC Management LLC with violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and names another Butkus-controlled entity, DK Auto LLC, as a relief defendant. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants. It also seeks disgorgement with interest from the relief defendant.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Vaughn, Katherine H. Stella, and Andrea Fox with assistance from the Division of Enforcement’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. It was supervised by Peter Rosario, George Bagnall, and Stacy L. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Peter Lallas and supervised by James Connor. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations’ New York Field Office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:12:52.577756

The SEC’s complaint alleges that, between 2018 and 2023, Burak engaged in a fraudulent scheme to recruit investors in his so-called investment fund, Never Alone Capital LLC, by falsely representing himself as a wealthy hedge fund owner, telling investors that Never Alone was an investment fund, and claiming that investor money would be invested in “Wall Street” pursuant to a complex investment strategy, in some cases with a guaranteed return. Burak allegedly raised approximately $4 million from at least 17 investors, several of whom he met through a company that provides financial education programs in Spanish to the Latino community. However, as alleged in the complaint, Burak did not invest the money as he represented that he would. In fact, as alleged, Burak misappropriated the bulk of investor deposits, including to pay credit card charges for, among other things, luxury skin care and payments to an adult-only subscription service. Burak also allegedly sent investors false account statements that generally showed consistently positive returns, when in fact investors were consistently losing money. Burak eventually stopped responding to investors and, in an audio recording from July 2022, he stated, among other things, that he was fake, he did not have a real business, and he was stealing money from people.

“As our complaint alleges, Burak convinced investors to trust him by lying about his investment expertise and strategies and then stole their money,” said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “We remain committed to identifying and holding accountable those who prey on innocent investors, and encourage those who suspect they are victims of fraud to report it to the SEC.”

The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Burak with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, as well as conduct-based injunctions.

In a parallel action, the New York County District Attorney’s Office today filed criminal charges against Burak.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Bari R. Nadworny, Thomas Feretic, and Lindsay S. Moilanen under the supervision of Tejal D. Shah of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Sushila Rao Pentapati and Ms. Nadworny under the supervision of Preethi Krishnamurthy.

Under the rule, a covered clearing agency that provides central counterparty services for U.S. Treasury securities must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to requir","The Securities and Exchange Commission today extended the compliance dates for Rule 17ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(A) and (B) under the Securities Exchange Act by one year to Dec. 31, 2026, for eligible cash market transactions, and June 30, 2027, for eligible repo market transactions. Under the rule, a covered clearing agency that provides central counterparty services for U.S. Treasury securities must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require that every direct participant of the covered clearing agency submit for clearance and settlement all eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to which it is a counterparty. The rule also requires a covered clearing agency to identify and monitor its direct participants’ submissions of transactions for clearing, including how the covered clearing agency would address a failure to submit transactions.

The Commission also issued a temporary exemption regarding Exchange Act Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i). This rule requires that covered clearing agencies have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate, collect, and hold margin amounts from a direct participant for its proprietary positions in U.S. Treasury securities separately and independently from margin calculated and collected from that direct participant in connection with U.S. Treasury securities transactions by an indirect participant that relies on the services provided by the direct participant to access the U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities. Under this temporary exemption, a U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency is not required to enforce its written policies and procedures regarding Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) until Sept. 30, 2025, instead of the original March 31, 2025, compliance date.

“The U.S. Treasury market is a critical piece of the global financial system. New rules must be implemented properly, and any operational issues must be addressed,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. “This one-year extension provides additional time to implement and validate operational changes. Direct participants will also have more time to implement important risk management changes to comply with U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency rules. The Commission stands ready to engage with market participants on issues associated with implementation.”

The extension will provide additional time for further engagement on compliance, operational, and interpretive questions, and facilitate an orderly implementation of the rules. The temporary exemption allows covered clearing agencies not to enforce policies and procedures established pursuant to Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) against any market participants currently clearing indirect participant activity that are not ready to comply with such policies and procedures, but it does not affect the ability of a covered clearing agency to implement such policies and procedures for those that are prepared to comply. If a direct participant of a U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency determines to offer certain access models or segregated margin accounts, the covered clearing agency would be obligated to enforce those rules regarding such models or accounts against the relevant participant, and the direct participant must comply with those rules.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:12:55.125483

According to the SEC’s order, from approximately June 2020 through October 2023, One Oak and DeRosa recommended that DeRosa’s customers at an unaffiliated broker-dealer, at which he was simultaneously employed, convert more than 180 brokerage accounts to advisory accounts at One Oak. Most of these customers were elderly and had been long-time customers of DeRosa’s at the broker-dealer, which charged the customers on a commission basis. According to the order, One Oak and DeRosa ignored their fiduciary duty and failed to adequately disclose that the conversions from brokerage accounts to advisory accounts would result in significantly higher fees for the clients and increased compensation for DeRosa; nor did they disclose the resulting conflict of interest. The order finds that the change in fee structure resulted in significantly increased costs, but the clients generally received no additional services or benefits. The order further finds that One Oak and DeRosa failed to adequately consider whether it was in their clients’ best interests to convert their brokerage accounts to advisory accounts, and in fact, many of the accounts were not suitable to be advisory accounts.

“We remain committed to holding accountable investment advisers who breach their fiduciary duties at the expense of retail clients,” said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. “One Oak and DeRosa converted brokerage accounts to advisory accounts when it benefitted them through higher fees, but that conversion was not in their clients’ best interests.”

The SEC’s order finds that One Oak and DeRosa willfully violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that One Oak also violated the compliance rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, One Oak consented to an order requiring it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review certain of its policies and procedures related to its retail business. Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, DeRosa agreed to a civil penalty of $75,000 and to a nine-month industry suspension.

Bad actors have become increasingly sophisticated and, in the event of a breach, may be able to use the names, addresses, and years of birth to impersonate a customer or broker-dealer and gain access to a customer’s account. Providing an exemption from the requirement to report this PII to the CAT will help mitigate potential security risks.

“Over 12 years ago, the CAT was designed with the goal of creating a modernized audit trail system to enable regulators to analyze and reconstruct market events,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. “Today’s exemptive order eliminates the requirement to report names, addresses, and years of birth for any U.S. natural person who trades in the stock market and recognizes that such information is not necessary to achieve CAT’s objectives. Despite today’s action, bad actors and other miscreants who engage in insider trading, market manipulation, and other schemes should be forewarned that the Commission has more than sufficient investigative tools to hold them accountable.”

Names, addresses, and years of birth were originally required to be collected in the CAT to facilitate the generation of unique anonymized customer IDs and to help regulators identify the person(s) responsible for a trade. In 2020, the Commission issued an order exempting the reporting of some of the most sensitive PII, including social security numbers. Today, the Commission issued an order exempting additional PII from the CAT.

Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.

“It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. “This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.”

This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.

Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.

Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities.

Additionally, the Commission publishes on its website failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:13:00.758185

The addresses in question reportedly moved nearly $1 billion worth of funds linked to sanctioned entities. Most of the transactions funded Houthi operations in Yemen and the Red Sea region.

Slava Demchuk, a crypto-focused money laundering specialist and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime consultant told Cointelegraph that “the inclusion of Houthi-linked wallets reflects a broader recognition of crypto’s role in geopolitical conflicts and terrorism financing.” He added:

“The implications are far-reaching — compliance frameworks must adapt swiftly, attribution efforts will intensify, and decentralized platforms may face increased scrutiny.“

Demchuk highlighted that the situation reshapes the regulatory landscape. According to him, crypto “is now firmly within the scope of international security.

Who are the Houthis?

The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, are a Yemeni political and armed movement that emerged from the Zaidi Shia community. Originating as a revivalist and reformist group, they later became a major force in Yemen’s ongoing conflict.

In recent years, the Houthis have engaged in attacks against both military and civilian vessels in the Red Sea with missiles and drones. In January, US President Donald Trump designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization.

The announcement noted that “the Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade.” The group was recently struck by a US bombing campaign.

Garantex: Russia’s crypto laundromat

Garantex is a Russian crypto exchange that was sanctioned and shut down in early March after purportedly helping money-laundering efforts. At the time, Tether — the leading stablecoin operator and issuer of USDt — froze $27 million in USDt on the platform, forcing it to halt operations.

The platform has reportedly shifted millions of dollars as it sought to reboot under its new brand, “Grinex.”

In mid-March, officials with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation announced the arrest of Lithuanian national Aleksej Bešciokov, who was alleged to have operated the cryptocurrency exchange Garantex.

The arrest of the alleged Garantex founder was based on US charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

This model provides a structured and systematic approach to establishing and managing a successful Global Capability Center (GCC). With over two decades of experience assisting clients in achieving industry leadership, I have found that establishing and running GCCs through the BOTT model is key to maximizing both effectiveness and efficiency. A Global Capability Center is an established entity within an organization designed to harness global talent and resources to deliver high-value services and capabilities. These centers are typically located in regions with a rich talent pool and cost advantages, enabling organizations to optimize operational efficiency, drive innovation and enhance service delivery across various functions such as IT, finance, human resources and research and development. By centralizing expertise and capabilities, GCCs play a crucial role in supporting an organization's global operations and strategic objectives. The BOTT model, a strategic framework for establishing GCCs, encompasses four phases: build, operate, transform and transfer. It is also popularly known as BOT (build, operate and transfer). In many cases today, service providers work closely with industry players to assist with GCCs. As per the Everest Group, a couple of years ago, the number of GCCs set up using the BOT model accounted for less than 10% and is now nearly 40%. When combined with an assisted approach, that figure increases to over 90% of GCC setups today. Each phase of the BOTT model involves specific steps and guidelines to ensure a smooth transition and successful execution: In the Build phase, several key activities must be meticulously executed to establish a robust foundation for the GCC: • Strategic Planning And Design: Craft a comprehensive blueprint that aligns with the organization's strategic objectives, detailing the GCC's structure, functions and operational workflows. I have seen that working with experienced service providers helps in this stage immensely. • Site Selection And Infrastructure Development: Identify an optimal location based on talent availability, cost efficiency and regulatory environment, and then develop the necessary physical and technological infrastructure. • Talent Acquisition And Onboarding: Recruit a skilled workforce that meets the GCC's specific requirements, including sourcing talent, conducting interviews and onboarding new hires. Over the years, I have seen that relying only on just-in-time hiring may not help. Companies should work with service providers who can utilize their bench, too, for talent deployment. • Technology Implementation: Deploy state-of-the-art technology solutions to enable seamless operations, including IT systems, software applications and communication networks. • Regulatory Compliance And Risk Management: Ensure adherence to local laws and regulations and implement risk management strategies to mitigate potential challenges. • Stakeholder Engagement And Communication: Establish clear communication channels with key stakeholders to ensure alignment and support throughout the build phase. In the Operate phase, the focus shifts to ensure the GCC functions optimally: • Operational Management: Oversee day-to-day operations, including HR, finance, legal, procurement, workflows and resource allocation, and adhere to service-level agreements (SLAs). • Facilities Management: Manage building operations, maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards, conduct regular maintenance and repairs and implement robust security measures. • Performance Monitoring And Reporting: Track KPIs to measure effectiveness and identify ways to improve operations. Based on my experience, a joint program governance team is key here. • Quality Assurance: Implement rigorous quality control measures, including regular audits, process reviews and corrective actions. • Talent Management: Foster a skilled and motivated workforce through ongoing training, development programs and performance evaluations. • Technology Maintenance And Upgrades: Ensure the technology infrastructure remains robust and up to date through regular maintenance and the integration of new technologies. • Security Management: Implement comprehensive security protocols to protect against cyber threats, unauthorized access and data breaches. • Stakeholder Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication with key stakeholders, including clients, senior management and team members. The Transform phase focuses on elevating the GCC to a higher level of performance and innovation: • Integration Of Advanced Technologies: Implement cutting-edge technologies such as AI, machine learning and robotic process automation. • Process Reengineering: Redesign and optimize existing processes to improve productivity and reduce costs. • Workforce Upskilling: Provide comprehensive training and development programs to equip the workforce with new skills and competencies. • Change Management: Implement structured change management initiatives to ensure smooth adoption of new technologies and processes. • Performance Optimization: Continuously monitor and analyze performance metrics to identify areas for improvement. • Innovation And Continuous Improvement: Foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement by encouraging creative problem-solving and adopting new ideas. In the Transfer phase, the focus should be on ensuring a seamless handover of the GCC to the organization: • Transition Planning: Develop a comprehensive transition plan that outlines the steps and timelines for the handover process. • Knowledge Transfer: Conduct extensive knowledge transfer sessions to equip the organization's team with the necessary skills and expertise. • Asset And Responsibility Transfer: Facilitate the transfer of all physical and intellectual assets, including technology infrastructure and operational processes. • Operational Handover: Ensure smooth operational handover by transitioning day-to-day management responsibilities to the organization's team. • Post-Transfer Support: Offer ongoing support and assistance post-transfer to ensure the GCC continues operating efficiently. • Performance Monitoring And Evaluation: Establish mechanisms for continuous performance monitoring and evaluation to beat the organization's expectations. The BOTT model offers a comprehensive and structured approach to establishing and managing GCCs. By meticulously executing each phase, organizations can optimize operational efficiency, drive innovation and enhance service delivery. Based on my decades of experience, I have seen that leveraging the expertise of service firms experienced in the BOTT model can further mitigate risks and ensure a smooth, value-driven establishment of GCCs. Ultimately, the successful implementation of the BOTT model enables organizations to fully leverage the capabilities of their GCCs, supporting their global operations and strategic objectives.

Read the second installment here. “From the Beginning, California promised much. While yet barely a name on the map, it entered American awareness as a symbol of renewal. It was a final frontier: of geography and of expectation.” — Kevin Starr, “Americans and the California Dream, 1850-1915”

California’s economic, academic, media, and political establishment still embraces the notion of the state’s inevitable supremacy. “The future depends on us,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said at his first inauguration, “and we will seize this moment.” Others see California as deserving and capable of nationhood, a topic that has resurfaced with Trump’s presidency as it reflects, as a New York Times column put it, “the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society.”

Critics say this vision is at odds with the facts on the ground. Rather than the exemplar of a new “progressive capitalism” and a model for social justice, California both accommodates the highest number of billionaires and the highest cost-adjusted poverty rate. It has the third highest gap, behind just Washington, D.C., and Louisiana, between middle- and upper-middle-income earners of any state. Nearly one in five Californians – many working – lives in poverty (using a cost-of-living adjusted poverty rate); the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) estimates another one-fifth live in near-poverty – roughly 15 million people in total.

“California” is a model that no longer delivers. To be sure, California has a huge GDP, paced largely by high real estate prices and the stock value of a handful of huge tech firms. It retains the inertia from its glory days, particularly in technology and entertainment, but that edge is evaporating as tech firms flee the state and Hollywood productions are shot around the world. For all its strengths, California has the nation’s second-highest rate of unemployment with lagging job growth, particularly in comparison to its neighbors and chief rivals, notably Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.

The signs of failure are evident on the streets. Roughly half the nation’s homeless population lives in the Golden State, many concentrated in disease- and crime-ridden tent cities in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Barely one in three state residents – and only one in four younger voters – now considers California a good place to achieve the American dream. Increasingly, California is where this dream goes to die.

‘San Francisco Gentry Liberalism’

The roots of California are long and deep. In August, for example, the New York Times reported how its development into a one-party state controlled by progressive Democrats has made it the country’s center of political corruption. “Over the last 10 years,” the Times reported, “576 public officials in California have been convicted on federal corruption charges, according to Justice Department reports, exceeding the number of cases in states better known for public corruption, including New York, New Jersey and Illinois.”

California's high taxes and regulatory burdens are turning the Golden State into a trapped bear. AP

Ironically, the state’s corruption and decline have been expressed through policies long touted as symbols of progressive enlightenment and virtue – the odd marriage of oligarchal wealth and woke political consciousness some describe as “San Francisco gentry liberalism.”

Under this regime, epitomized by Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris, progressivism has lost its historic embrace of upward mobility and replaced it with an ideology obsessed with race, gender, and climate. It has produced a political leadership class that, for the most part, is largely made up of long-time government or union operatives. In the legislature, the vast majority of Democrats have little to no experience in the private sector. The failure may have been accelerated by the secular decline of the once-powerful Republican Party over the past two decades. This decline removed the incentives for Democrats to concern themselves with moderate voters of either party.

This development represents a distinct break even with California’s pro-growth progressive past, which helped make the Golden State a symbol of American opportunity, innovation, and prosperity. The late historian and one-time state librarian Kevin Starr observed that, under the governorship of Democrat Pat Brown in the late fifties and early sixties, California enjoyed “a golden age of consensus and achievement, a founding era in which California fashioned and celebrated itself as an emergent nation-state.” In 1971, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith described the state government as run by “a proud, competent civil service,” enjoying some of “the best school systems in the country.”

This may seem something like ancient mythology to most Californians today. If the builder Pat Brown was an exemplar of “Responsible Liberalism,” California’s government today has been ranked by Wallet Hub as the least efficient in delivering services relative to the tax burden. Pat Brown’s son Jerry – who was governor from 1975-1983 and then again from 2011-2019 – and his successor, Newsom, epitomize the triumph of ideology over effectiveness. Theirs is a kind of performative progressivism that shrugs about things like roads that are now among the nation’s worst, a high-speed bullet train plagued with endless delays and massive cost overruns, and a failure to boost critical water systems in a perennially drought-threatened state.

In exchange for all this, the progressive regime has stuck ordinary Californians and businesses with some of the nation’s highest taxes and greatest regulatory burdens. California’s business climate is rated at or near the bottom in most business surveys. The Tax Foundation’s 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index, which evaluates taxes in five categories, also lists California at number 49, with only New Jersey trailing.

These policies have made California exceptionally expensive for both businesses and households. Indeed, according to current estimates, only Hawaii and Massachusetts have a higher cost of living. California has the highest average housing, second highest transportation, and third highest food expenses in the country. Much of this is invisible to the top 20% and 5% of California households, who enjoy median incomes of $72,500 and $129,000 greater than their national counterparts, but is widely felt in the state’s less affluent areas.

Pell-Mell Into Climatism

California progressivism today embraces many causes – undocumented immigrants, transgender kids, reparations for slavery – but nothing has shaped the state’s contemporary politics more in recent years than a commitment to what Newsom described in 2018 as “climate leadership.”

In embracing the catastrophism that defines climate change as an existential threat to life on the planet, Newsom has left behind the old progressive notion of focusing on materially improving people’s lives by embracing inherently uncertain computer models predicting danger.

In California, experts from what Bjorn Lomborg, a leading skeptic of climate catastrophism, calls “the climate industrial complex” provide the justification for staggeringly expensive, socially regressive mandates based on the conjured models; the state mandates GHG reductions but leaves implementation in the hands of state agencies closely aligned with the green lobby.

This allows the legislature to look the other way as state climate policies knowingly increase poor and working family costs and shift billions of dollars to the wealthy in the relentless pursuit of unilaterally modeled carbon emission targets that even advocates admit cannot possibly “fix” the global climate. Indeed, in 2023, the California Air Resources Board belatedly disclosed current state climate policies would disproportionately harm households earning less than $100,000 per year while boosting incomes for those above this threshold.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks out against oil drilling in his push for ""climate-friendly"" subsidies.

Newsom’s dogged emphasis on climate change – and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2045 – has meant massive subsidies for wind and solar, mandates to reduce personal car use by nearly three times the temporary cuts caused by pandemic lockdowns, electrification of home appliances at a cost of many thousands of dollars per household, and even cuts to dairy and livestock emissions with technology mandates, accelerating the relocation of these food producers to other states and increasing food prices.

To justify the pain, state regulators estimated that paying for these changes today would prevent future climate damage, all of which depend on highly uncertain projections spanning, in some cases, hundreds of years in the future. The problem is that even if damage projections are remotely accurate, California’s climate law recognizes that the state cannot affect the global climate unless everyone else in the world follows suit. In fact, global emissions are rising, especially from China, which exported over $120 billion in goods and services, notably manufactured goods, often produced with coal, to California in 2023.

Also based on “expert” opinion, the state has embraced a policy to force people to buy electric vehicles by 2035, a policy increasingly questionable amidst slowing demand for these vehicles. Once again, state officials relying on speculative projections proclaim that the policy will benefit the state’s consumers and the environment, although this seems questionable, given, as Volvo suggests, the energy demands of building such cars may take years to have a positive impact.

Fires: The Price of Climate Delusion

The recent fires that incinerated a swath of Los Angeles revealed the shortcomings of the current climate-obsessed regime. To be sure, President Trump’s claim that water policies created the conflagration is largely false, but the lack of attention to water delivery and forest maintenance, a consistent aspect of the Jerry Brown-Newsom era, clearly contributed to the intensity of the blaze.

In 2014, California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure allocating $2.7 billion to increase state water storage capacity, including the building of new reservoirs. These facilities would not only improve an aging water system neglected for decades but also capture and store precipitation that may occur in less frequent, more intense storms. Yet, even government apologists concede that, 10 years later, progress has been too slow, with deeply entrenched bureaucracies issuing permits only at a “glacial” pace.

The state's lack of attention to water delivery and forest maintenance is connected to devastating fires such as the one that devatsated Pacific Palisades this year.

Rather than building on the achievements of Pat Brown, state officials spent a quarter of a billion dollars helping environmental groups destroy dams and hydroelectric generation along the Klamath River in northern California. While this effort may yet improve fish habitat as intended, its initial results are sobering. Most of the river’s existing fish, crustaceans, and other organisms were killed by toxic sediment as the dams were removed, and unanticipated tar-pit-like mud exposure trapped large mammals, including protected wild horses. In March 2024, fish that state biologists confidently released into the restored river perished in a mass “die-off” within two days.

These misplaced priorities are also mirrored in Los Angeles, where reservoirs were left empty, leaving water unavailable and water hydrants without pressure. Both the state and local governments have failed to sufficiently fund fire-fighting operations, except for approving lavish pensions.

The climate catastrophists may promote fires as a sign of the coming apocalypse, but still consistently oppose effective fire management, as the Little Hoover Commission found as far back as 2018, discouraging such things as controlled burns and brush clearance. Policies of controlled burns, practiced by Native Americans and in areas like Western Australia, have been largely ignored.

Even as he rails against “misinformation,” Newsom blamed the recent LA fires, as he has earlier blazes, on climate change. This claim has been widely debunked by scientists like Steve Koonin and Roger Pielke and the U.S. Geological Service. Undaunted, Newsom’s neat solution appears to be to sue the oil companies for fires made far worse by Newsom’s own policies.

The Greening of Decline

Charred landscapes and burnt houses reflect one legacy of California’s progressive obsessions. More widespread has been the impact of taxes and climate regulations on the overall economy, particularly for minorities and working- and middle-class households, who were once the focus of traditional liberalism.

Public unions, whose members' livelihoods depend on big government, have become a dominant force in California.

This shift has been bolstered by the ascendancy of public employee unions and the remarkable growth of the state bureaucracy. California, under Pat Brown, largely avoided public employee unions, but his son Jerry and other governors reversed this policy. Since 2022, even with budget shortfalls, California has among the highest rate of government sector growth in the country. Today, they are widely seen as a dominant force in Sacramento. Particularly powerful has been the 310,000-member California Teachers Association. Their numbers have continued to swell, even amidst budget shortfalls, at a faster rate than private-sector employment.

Public employees, or their union representatives, constitute a powerful part of California’s emerging class hierarchy. Increasingly, their livelihoods are tied to an agenda of ever more regulation and taxes. Public workers, of course, also share these costs, but more regulation also engenders more jobs for the bureaucracy.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of Californians, particularly the working class, do not enjoy such benefits. In assessing the impacts of climate policies, environmental and civil rights attorney Jennifer Hernandez has dubbed these policies “the Green Jim Crow,” linking the state’s climate regulatory effort to the impoverishment of millions. California has the highest energy prices in the continental U.S., double the national average, which has exacerbated “energy poverty , ” particularly among the poor and those in the less temperate interior.

In 2023, Chapman University researcher Bheki Mahalo found that the tech and information sector accounted for close to two-thirds of state GDP, compared to 8.5% in 1985. Virtually every sector associated with blue-collar employment – manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture – has declined while most others have stagnated.

Consider California’s once vibrant fossil fuel industry. The state’s last major oil firm, Chevron, recently moved to Houston. In 1996, California imported less than 10% of its crude oil from foreign sources. In 2023, foreign suppliers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia accounted for over 60% of the state’s supplies. This continued shuttering of the state’s fossil fuel industry will cost California as many as 300,000 generally high-paying jobs, roughly half held by minorities, and will devastate, in particular, the San Joaquin Valley, where 40,000 jobs depend on the oil industry.

Other blue-collar industries – construction, manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture – are also suffering under California’s climate policies. Over the past decade, it has fallen into the bottom half of states in manufacturing sector employment, ranking 44th in 2023; its industrial new job creation has paled in comparison to gains from competitors such as Nevada, Kentucky, Michigan, and Florida. Even without adjusting for costs, no California metro area ranks in the U.S. top 10 in terms of well-paying, blue-collar jobs. But four – Ventura, Los Angeles, San Jose, and San Diego – sit among the bottom ten.

But not all the damage has been limited to “the carbon economy.” Progressive climate, labor, and tax policies have chased a broad range of companies out of the state, including an array of leading companies tied to professional services and engineering: Jacobs Engineering, Parsons, Bechtel, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Charles Schwab, and McKesson. Even Hollywood is hemorrhaging jobs, and recently, In and Out Burger, the state’s widely beloved fast food chain, announced it is planning a move to Tennessee. California is increasingly losing ground both in tech and high-end business services to sprawling, low-density metro areas like Austin, Nashville, Orlando, Charlotte, Salt Lake City, and Raleigh.

California, once the land of opportunity, is the single worst state in the nation when it comes to creating jobs that pay above average, while it is at the top of the heap in creating below-average and low-paying jobs. The state hemorrhaged 1.6 million above-average-paying jobs in the past decade, more than twice as many as any other state. Since 2008, the state has created five times as many low-wage jobs as high-wage jobs. In the past three years, the situation worsened, with 78.1% of all jobs added in California from lower-than-average paying industries versus 61% for the nation as a whole.

The only sector that has seen a big growth in higher-wage jobs has been the government, which is funded by tax receipts from the struggling private sector. Public sector employment is growing at about the same pace as jobs overall in California, but over the decade at twice the national pace. The average annual pay for those public sector government jobs is now almost double that of private sector jobs.

The Housing Crisis: Middle-Class Kill Shot

The lack of well-paying jobs meshes poorly with high living costs, notably in terms of housing. Here again, climate politics play a critical role in driving high housing prices in California. In the late 1960s, the value of the typical California home was more than four times the average household’s income. Today, it’s worth more than 11 times. The median California home is priced nearly 2.5 times higher than the median national home, according to 2022 Census data.

A key driver of this price hike is climate policy restraints on suburban development and single-family housing, supposedly to cut residential emissions. These restrictions push putting new housing close to transit in a state where barely 3% of employees use it to get to work, according to the American Community Survey. Perhaps more to the point, these policies are not what most Californians want. One recent PPIC survey has found that 70% of Californians prefer single-family residences, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, and oppose legislation, written by Democratic Senator Scott Wiener, that banned single-family zoning in much of the state.

The state has tried to sell its density dream as a means to boost production as well as lower prices. It has not worked out. From 2010 to 2023, California’s housing stock rose by just 7.9% over this period, lower than the national increase (10.3%), and well below housing growth in Arizona (13.8%), Nevada (14.7%), Texas (24%), and Florida (16.2%). These states are also the primary beneficiaries of California’s outmigration. An unusually large pool of affluent households is “stuck” and bids up prices in urban rental markets.

California now has the nation's second-lowest homeownership rate.

Today, homeownership is becoming rarer among California residents. The state now has the nation’s second lowest homeownership rate, at 55.9%, slightly above New York (55.4%). High prices impact young people, particularly on the homeownership rate.

Homeownership for Californians under 35 has fallen by more than half since 1980 and is plummeting even among people in their 40s and 50s. Minorities are particularly impacted by these initiatives. Based on census data analyzed by demographer Wendell Cox, the state’s African American homeownership rate is 35.5% – well below the national rate of 44% – and the state’s Latino homeownership rate ranked 41st nationwide.

From Surfboard to Walker?

If you think of California’s wealth-creation machine as a conveyor belt, continually providing generations with a stake in society through their homes, that belt has now stalled. Reduced economic opportunity and lack of affordable housing have created something once thought impossible – population growth well below the national average. In virtually every survey exploring why residents are leaving the state, housing costs are at the top of the list.

Increasingly, California’s demographics resemble the pattern of out-migration long associated with northeastern and midwestern states. Since 2000, more than 4 million net domestic migrants, a population about the same as the Seattle metropolitan area, have moved to other parts of the nation from California. Since 2020, the pace has picked up, with almost 1. 5 million domestic migrants in just four years.

Many leaving the state are in their 30s and 40s, precisely the group that tends to buy houses and start businesses. In 2022, California lost over 200,000 net migrants older than 25, the bulk of whom had either four-year or associate degrees. The groups showing the biggest tendency to leave, according to IRS numbers, are those in their late 30s to late 50s, which includes people who tend to have families.

At the same time, international migration, long a source of demographic vitality, has lagged behind other key states, notably Texas. As the Brookings Institution has noted, from 2010 to 2018, the foreign-born population of Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, Columbus, Charlotte, Nashville, and Orlando increased by more than 20%, while San Francisco’s foreign-born population grew only 11%, and New York’s grew by 5%.

The state retains by far the nation’s largest foreign-born population, but even the massive movement allowed under Biden’s open border policy since 2021 failed to reverse population declines in big California cities. With the border now effectively closed, this last source of population growth is likely to decline.

By losing immigrants and younger people, the state is effectively consuming its “seed corn.” The state’s total fertility rate, long above the national average, is now the nation’s 10th lowest and falling faster than the national average as well as among its key competitors. Los Angeles and San Francisco rank last and second-to-last in birthrates among the 53 major U.S. metropolitan areas. In California, only Riverside/San Bernardino exceeds the national average for births among women aged between 15 and 50, according to the American Community Survey.

The state's elderly population is growing even as young families leave for lower-cost areas.

Ultimately California, the birthplace of youth culture, is getting old, in some places more resembling Hawaii than the entrepreneurial powerhouse of the past. From 2010 to 2018, California aged 50% more rapidly than the rest of the country, according to the American Community Survey. As of 2022, 21%, or 8.3 million people, were over the age of 60 in California, and according to the California Department of Aging, this population is expected to grow by 40% in the next 10 years. By 2036, seniors will be a larger share of the population than kids under the age of 18. California is gradually ditching the surfboard and adopting the walker.

Needed: A New California Agenda

Gavin Newsom’s response to the state’s decline has been not to call for major reform but for “Trump proofing” the state, spending tens of millions on lawsuits. Such gestures do not address how California can maintain its status as the epicenter of “the new economy” and address the vast divides between the elite and highly educated, and the vast mass of our residents.

Rather than fight the president at every turn, California can find ways to take advantage of the new regime. After all, hanging on to the climate agenda is doing very little good for Californians or the planet. California has reduced its emissions since 2006 at roughly the same rate as the rest of the country. The fires have largely erased even these gains, as does the fact that when people or companies flee the state, their carbon signature tends to increase.

Oddly, Trump could force needed policy changes in order to bring in federal help, something Newsom has already done in regard to water policy. The notion that California has a better model – the rationale for the Newsom-led “resistance” – does not sell in the rest of the country, much less at the White House. In a national 2024 survey conducted for the Los Angeles Times, only 15% of respondents felt that California is a model other states should copy; 39% said the state was not a model and should not be emulated; 87% said the state was too expensive; and 77% would not consider moving to California.

Yet, for all its problems, California is far from hopeless, and its promise is not extinguished. It remains uniquely gifted in terms of climate, innovation, and entrepreneurial verve. Sitting at the juncture of Asia, Latin America, and North America, it can once again become, as Kevin Starr noted, America’s “final frontier: of geography and of expectation.”",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:19.580191

newsapi_7,"Trump’s April 2, 2025 Tariff Announcement: What It Means for Global Supply Chains and Logistics",https://logisticsviewpoints.com/2025/04/03/trumps-april-2-2025-tariff-announcement-what-it-means-for-global-supply-chains-and-logistics/,2025-04-03T11:30:57Z,NewsAPI,,,"Yesterday afternoon, the Trump Administration formalized a broad package of tariff measures labeled as a “Declaration of Economic Independence.” The measures introduce both general and highly targeted tariffs, directly affecting global supply chains, cross-border logistics, and international trade flows.

","Yesterday afternoon, the Trump Administration formalized a broad package of tariff measures labeled as a “Declaration of Economic Independence.” The measures introduce both general and highly targeted tariffs, directly affecting global supply chains, cross-border logistics, and international trade flows.

The policy includes universal tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, product-specific duties, and for the first time, the suspension of the de minimis exemption for certain low-value imports from China.

Summary of the Key Tariff Actions

Tariff Action Description Effective Date 10% Universal Tariff Imposed on all imports April 5 Country-Specific Tariffs Up to 54% (China), 46% (Vietnam), 25% (Japan, South Korea), 20% (EU) April 9 25% Auto Tariff Global (finished vehicles and parts) April 3 Canada & Mexico Tariff 25% on non-USMCA-compliant goods Active Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain Duties Targeting low-value (<$800) Chinese postal shipments (de minimis exemption eliminated) May 2

The New De Minimis Suspension for China

An additional critical development is the revocation of duty-free treatment under the de minimis rule for certain Chinese and Hong Kong-origin goods, particularly small, low-value shipments typically entering the U.S. via express delivery and postal networks.

Starting May 2, 2025, all relevant low-value goods from China (including Hong Kong) entering the U.S. will now face:

Either a 30% ad valorem duty,

Or a specific duty of $25 to $50 per parcel depending on timing and carrier choice,

Removal from de minimis treatment (previously exempted shipments valued under $800).

This action, grounded in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), is justified by the administration as a response to the role of China’s logistics networks in facilitating the illegal export of synthetic opioids into the U.S.

For logistics providers, this creates new procedural requirements:

Carriers must collect and remit these duties to CBP.

Postal and express operators will need to report detailed shipment information through ACE (Automated Commercial Environment).

Formal entry procedures may apply to affected shipments.

Immediate Impact on Supply Chain and Logistics

Port and Border Operations

Increased demand leading to congestion at U.S. ports and cross-border points (Canada and Mexico).

Potential for capacity shortages and higher freight rates through Q2.

Parcel, Express, and Postal Shipments

Express and postal operators will face a regulatory and financial burden due to the de minimis suspension for China.

Higher import compliance costs for companies using small-parcel e-commerce models dependent on Chinese fulfillment centers.

Automotive Sector

The 25% auto tariff, combined with country-specific tariffs on Japan, the EU, and Korea, will significantly affect finished vehicle and component flows.

Canada and Mexico-Specific Dynamics

Canada faces a 25% tariff on non-USMCA goods and has responded with $21 billion in retaliatory measures. The U.S. Senate passed a symbolic resolution opposing the tariffs on Canada, supported by several Republican senators, citing concerns about the economic impact on integrated supply chains, especially in border states.

While USMCA-compliant goods retain duty-free status, the risk of compliance gaps and operational delays will affect North American supply chains, especially in the automotive, agriculture, and energy sectors.

Anticipated Longer-Term Shifts

Sourcing diversification is expected to accelerate, favoring Mexico, Latin America, and Southeast Asia (for non-tariffed or low-tariff goods).

Compliance costs will rise, especially in sectors exposed to China and Canada.

Logistics contracts may need to be renegotiated to account for higher landed costs and shifting demand patterns.

Trade disputes and retaliation risk from China, the EU, and others remain an open concern.

Recommended Supply Chain Actions

Conduct exposure analysis on all inbound flows from tariff-affected countries. Assess small-parcel and e-commerce models, especially if sourcing from China. Prepare for freight rate volatility and port congestion in Q2-Q3. Review USMCA compliance to secure exemptions for North American trade lanes. Enhance customs and trade compliance processes to navigate new parcel and duty reporting requirements.

These new policies represent a multi-dimensional challenge for the logistics industry, affecting freight flows, compliance, pricing, and supplier strategies. Supply chain professionals will need to act quickly to minimize operational disruption and control costs.

(Nasdaq: IXHL), (Incannex), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leading the way in developing new oral combination medicines, today announced that the Company has completed Phase 2 patient enrollment in the global Phase 2/3 RePOSA study of IHL-42X for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). IHL-42X is an oral fixed dose combination medicine designed to reduce the incidence of interruptions to breathing during sleep and improve sleep quality.

“We are excited to have achieved this milestone and deeply grateful to our investigators, site coordinators, and, especially to the sleep apnea patient community for its support. The pace at which we fully enrolled the Phase 2 portion of the RePOSA Phase 2/3 study strengthens our confidence in this program. OSA is a serious, chronic, and life-threatening condition, and we believe our once-daily oral medication - designed to target underlying causes of OSA - could offer meaningful benefits to patients,” Lou Barbato, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Incannex.

“What makes IHL-42X truly unique is that it’s the first new therapeutic in its class to target physiological pathways directly tied to the airway obstruction and CO 2 accumulation, both of which are characteristic of OSA. We are eager to report topline clinical data from Phase 2 portion of the study and progress to the larger Phase 3 as swiftly as possible,” said Mark Bleackley, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Incannex.

“We are pleased to have completed Phase 2 recruitment in the IHL-42X RePOSA clinical trial. The speed at which patients enrolled in the study was impressive, surpassing typical recruitment timelines for trials of this nature. This strong interest underscores the pressing need for more effective pharmaceutical options to manage OSA,” said Mira Baron, M.D., a lead investigator for the RePOSA Phase 2/3 trial, Palm Beach Research Center. “Despite the widespread global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, there is still no approved pharmaceutical therapy specifically for the treatment of OSA. The positive response from both clinicians and patients reflects the real-world demand for a well-tolerated and effective therapeutic option. IHL-42X represents an exciting and novel approach for filling this longstanding treatment gap. I look forward to seeing the progress we are making in partnership with Incannex to further advance this program and address a critical need in sleep medicine.”

The RePOSA Phase 2/3 is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IHL-42X in patients with mild to severe OSA, who are intolerant, non-compliant, or naïve to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. At least 560 patients will be recruited, with a total of 355 patients receiving IHL-42X over the course of the study.

The Phase 2 study is a four-week, dose-finding study comparing two dose strengths of IHL-42X (2.5 mg dronabinol/125 mg acetazolamide and 5 mg dronabinol/250 mg acetazolamide) to placebo. More than 120 patients were enrolled across 11 study sites in the U.S. Phase 2 results will determine the optimal dose strength to advance into the larger Phase 3 trial.

The Phase 3 expansion study will evaluate the selected IHL-42X dose over 52 weeks, comparing it to its individual active pharmaceutical ingredients, dronabinol and acetazolamide, at equivalent doses, and to placebo. This pivotal study will enroll approximately 440 patients across four treatment arms, with the goal of supporting future regulatory submission and providing a potential new treatment option for patients with OSA who are underserved by current therapies. Phase 2 trials sites will be rolled over into the Phase 3 expansion study, allowing for an efficient transition and minimizing downtime between study phases.

The Phase 2/3 study follows a recently completed successful pharmacokinetic (PK) study designed to support a future FDA 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) and aid in the analysis of the global Phase 2/3 RePOSA study data, in addition to an earlier Phase 2 clinical proof-of-concept trial. Additional information about the RePOSA study can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov under trial identifier NCT06146101.

About Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

Obstructive sleep apnea is a chronic, serious, and life-threatening condition characterized by frequent interruptions in breathing. Individuals with OSA experience apneic episodes, waking up gasping for air 15 to 30 times per hour. During apneic episodes, collapse and obstruction of the upper airway lead to intermittent cessation of breathing, hypoxia (low oxygen levels), and hypercapnia (inadequate expulsion of carbon dioxide). This results in poor quality of sleep, severe and daytime fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. OSA is also linked to serious medical conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, liver disease, and complications with medicines and during surgery.

More than 54 million adults in the U.S. and 936 million worldwide suffer from OSA, with prevalence on the rise due to aging populations, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and sedentary lifestyles. Public awareness is increasing, along with advancements in professional and consumer diagnostic technologies, contributing to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Notably, approximately 20% of adults with OSA are non-obese, and they are four times more likely to develop hypertension compared to obese individuals without OSA.

Current treatment options for moderate-to-severe OSA, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices and an injectable GIP/GLP-1 agonist for patients with obesity, have significant drawbacks in terms of long-term use and patient compliance. CPAP devices, which deliver pressurized air through a fitted mask worn during sleep, and current pharmacotherapy often face challenges with adherence and discontinuation. For patients who fail to comply with, or are intolerant of these treatments, surgical removal of excess throat tissue to widen the airway may be considered. However, success rates vary, and there are potential risks of surgical, as well as long-term post-surgical complications.

About IHL-42X

IHL-42X is designed to treat OSA by targeting its underlying pathophysiology. An oral fixed-dose combination of dronabinol and acetazolamide, IHL-42X is currently advancing through the RePOSA Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which is expected to enroll more 560 patients at sites worldwide.

Designed to act synergistically, IHL-42X uniquely targets two physiological pathways associated with the intermittent hypoxia (IH) and hypercapnia that characterize OSA. In a prior Australian Phase 2 clinical trial, IHL-42X was shown to reduce the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) in all dosage strengths, with the lowest dose reducing AHI by an average of 51 percent relative to baseline. RePOSA, a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial is underway, evaluating IHL-42X in individuals with OSA who are either non-compliant, intolerant, or naïve to positive airway pressure devices, including CPAP, with the Phase 2 portion conducted in the United States. A topline readout from the U.S. Phase 2 portion is anticipated in the first half of 2025.

(NASDAQ:NTLA), a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies, today announced the first patient has been dosed in MAGNITUDE-2, a global, pivotal Phase 3 trial of nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for the treatment of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN).

“We are pleased to have dosed the first patient with a treatment that has such strong potential to redefine the treatment paradigm for those living with ATTR with polyneuropathy. This is a debilitating, progressive disease that leaves people feeling increasingly helpless,” said Dr. Paulo Sgobbi, Medical Director, PSEG Clinical Research Center. “Through nex-z’s potential to favorably impact disease progression, patients living with ATTR polyneuropathy could experience life-changing benefit while being freed from the existing chronic treatment regimen of pills, injections and infusions.”

“This milestone marks important progress toward our goal of completing the MAGNITUDE-2 clinical program and we are optimistic the study will enable us to demonstrate nex-z’s potential to be the first to halt or reverse disease progression with a single dose in hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy,” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard, M.D.

The Phase 3 MAGNITUDE-2 study is informed by Intellia’s Phase 1 data, showing that a single dose of nex-z led to consistently rapid, deep and durable reduction in serum TTR. Intellia expects to present longer-term data from the Phase 1 studies of nex-z for both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy later this year. The company plans to submit a biologics licensing application (BLA) for ATTRv-PN by 2028.

About the MAGNITUDE-2 Study

The pivotal Phase 3 MAGNITUDE-2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) in approximately 50 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). The primary endpoint of the study includes a modified neuropathy impairment score and change in serum TTR levels. Adult patients with ATTRv-PN will be randomized 1:1 to receive a single 55 mg infusion of nex-z or placebo. For more information on MAGNITUDE-2 (NCT06672237), please visit clinicaltrials.gov.

About nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z, formerly known as NTLA-2001)

Based on Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR/Cas9 technology, nex-z has the potential to become the first one-time treatment for transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Nex-z is an investigational in vivo CRISPR-based therapy designed to inactivate the TTR gene that encodes for the mutated transthyretin (TTR) protein causing the polyneuropathy. Interim Phase 1 clinical data showed the administration of nex-z led to consistent, deep and long-lasting TTR reduction. Nex-z has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designations by the U.S. FDA for both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy. Nex-z has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. FDA and European Commission. Intellia leads development and commercialization of nex-z as part of a multi-target discovery, development and commercialization collaboration with Regeneron.

About Transthyretin (ATTR) Amyloidosis

Transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, is a rare, progressive and fatal disease. Hereditary ATTR (ATTRv) amyloidosis occurs when a person is born with mutations in the TTR gene, which causes the liver to produce structurally abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein with a propensity to misfold. These damaged proteins build up as amyloid in the body, causing serious complications in multiple tissues, including the heart, nerves and digestive system. ATTRv amyloidosis predominantly manifests as polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN), which can lead to nerve damage, or cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM), which can lead to heart failure. Some individuals without the genetic mutation produce non-mutated, or wild-type TTR proteins that become unstable over time, misfolding and aggregating in disease-causing amyloid deposits. This condition, called wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, primarily affects the heart. There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide living with ATTRv amyloidosis and between 200,000 and 500,000 people with ATTRwt amyloidosis. There is no known cure for ATTR amyloidosis and currently available medications are limited to slowing accumulation of misfolded TTR protein.

1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options

Financial market developments

Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that, since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting on 29-30 January 2025, euro area and US markets had moved in opposite directions in a highly volatile political environment. In the euro area, markets had focused on the near-term macroeconomic backdrop, with incoming data in the euro area surprising on the upside. Lower energy prices responding in part to the prospect of a ceasefire in Ukraine, looser fiscal policy due to increased defence spending and a potential relaxation of Germany’s fiscal rules had supported investor sentiment. This contrasted with developments in the United States, where market participants’ assessment of the new US Administration’s policy decisions had turned more negative amid fears of tariffs driving prices up and dampening consumer and business sentiment.

A puzzling feature of recent market developments had been the dichotomy between measures of policy uncertainty and financial market volatility. Global economic policy uncertainty had shot up in the final quarter of 2024 and had reached a new all-time high, surpassing the peak seen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. By contrast, volatility in euro area and US equity markets had remained muted, despite having broadly traced dynamics in economic policy uncertainty over the past 15 years. Only more recently, with the prospect of tariffs becoming more concrete, had stock market volatility started to pick up from low levels.

Risk sentiment in the euro area remained strong and close to all-time highs, outpacing the United States, which had declined significantly since the Governing Council's January monetary policy meeting. This mirrored the divergence of macroeconomic developments. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the euro area had turned positive in February 2025, reaching its highest level since April 2024. This was in contrast to developments in the United States, where economic surprises had been negative recently.

The divergence in investor appetite was most evident in stock markets. The euro area stock market continued to outperform its US counterpart, posting the strongest year-to-date performance relative to the US index in almost a decade. Stock market developments were aligned with analysts’ earnings expectations, which had been raised for European firms since the start of 2025. Meanwhile, US earnings estimates had been revised down continuously for the past eleven weeks.

Part of the recent outperformance of euro area equities stemmed from a catch-up in valuations given that euro area equities had performed less strongly than US stocks in 2024. Moreover, in spite of looming tariffs, the euro area equity market was benefiting from potential growth tailwinds, including a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, the greater prospect of a stable German government following the country’s parliamentary elections and the likelihood of increased defence spending in the euro area. The share prices of tariff-sensitive companies had been significantly underperforming their respective benchmarks in both currency areas, but tariff-sensitive stocks in the United States had fared substantially worse.

Market pricing also indicated a growing divergence in inflation prospects between the euro area and the United States. In the euro area, the market’s view of a gradual disinflation towards the ECB’s 2% target remained intact. One-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead stood at around 2%, while the one-year forward inflation-linked swap rate one year ahead continued to stand somewhat below 2%. However, inflation compensation had moved up across maturities on 5 March 2025. In the United States, one-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead had increased significantly, likely driven in part by bond traders pricing in the inflationary effects of tariffs on US consumer prices. Indicators of the balance of risks for inflation suggested that financial market participants continued to see inflation risks in the euro area as broadly balanced across maturities.

Changing growth and inflation prospects had also been reflected in monetary policy expectations for the euro area. On the back of slightly lower inflation compensation due to lower energy prices, expectations for ECB monetary policy had edged down. A 25 basis point cut was fully priced in for the current Governing Council monetary policy meeting, while markets saw a further rate cut at the following meeting as uncertain. Most recently, at the time of the meeting, rate investors no longer expected three more 25 basis point cuts in the deposit facility rate in 2025. Participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts, finalised in the last week of February, had continued to expect a slightly faster easing cycle.

Turning to euro area market interest rates, the rise in nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates since the 11-12 December 2024 Governing Council meeting had largely been driven by improving euro area macroeconomic data, while the impact of US factors had been small overall. Looking back, euro area ten-year nominal and real OIS rates had overall been remarkably stable since their massive repricing in 2022, when the ECB had embarked on the hiking cycle. A key driver of persistently higher long-term rates had been the market’s reassessment of the real short-term rate that was expected to prevail in the future. The expected real one-year forward rate four years ahead had surged in 2022 as investors adjusted their expectations away from a “low-for-long” interest rate environment, suggesting that higher real rates were expected to be the new normal.

The strong risk sentiment had also been transmitted to euro area sovereign bond spreads relative to yields on German government bonds, which remained at contained levels. Relative to OIS rates, however, the spreads had increased since the January monetary policy meeting – this upward move intensified on 5 March with the expectation of a substantial increase in defence spending. One factor behind the gradual widening of asset swap spreads over the past two years had been the increasing net supply of government bonds, which had been smoothly absorbed in the market.

Regarding the exchange rate, after a temporary depreciation the euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar, going above the level seen at the time of the January meeting. While the repricing of expectations regarding ECB monetary policy relative to the United States had weighed on the euro, as had global risk sentiment, the euro had been supported by the relatively stronger euro area economic outlook.

Ms Schnabel then considered the implications of recent market developments for overall financial conditions. Since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting, a broad-based and pronounced easing in financial conditions had been observed. This was driven primarily by higher equity prices and, to a lesser extent, by lower interest rates. The decline in euro area real risk-free interest rates across the yield curve implied that the euro area real yield curve remained well within neutral territory.

The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area

Mr Lane started his introduction by noting that, according to Eurostat’s flash release, headline inflation in the euro area had declined to 2.4% in February, from 2.5% in January. While energy inflation had fallen from 1.9% to 0.2% and services inflation had eased from 3.9% to 3.7%, food inflation had increased to 2.7%, from 2.3%, and non-energy industrial goods inflation had edged up from 0.5% to 0.6%.

Most indicators of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation had ticked down to 2.1% in January. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. But it remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. Recent wage negotiations pointed to a continued moderation in labour cost pressures. For instance, negotiated wage growth had decreased to 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The wage tracker and an array of survey indicators also suggested a continued weakening of wage pressures in 2025.

Inflation was expected to evolve along a slightly higher path in 2025 than had been expected in the Eurosystem staff’s December projections, owing to higher energy prices. At the same time, services inflation was expected to continue declining in early 2025 as the effects from lagged repricing faded, wage pressures receded and the impact of past monetary policy tightening continued to feed through. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations still stood at around 2%. Near-term market-based inflation compensation had declined across maturities, likely reflecting the most recent decline in energy prices, but longer-term inflation compensation had recently increased in response to emerging fiscal developments. Consumer inflation expectations had resumed their downward momentum in January.

According to the March ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to average 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. Compared with the December 2024 projections, inflation had been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025, reflecting stronger energy price dynamics in the near term. At the same time, the projections were unchanged for 2026 and had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2027. For core inflation, staff projected a slowdown from an average of 2.2% in 2025 to 2.0% in 2026 and to 1.9% in 2027 as labour cost pressures eased further, the impact of past shocks faded and the past monetary policy tightening continued to weigh on prices. The core inflation projection was 0.1 percentage points lower for 2025 compared with the December projections round, as recent data releases had surprised on the downside, but they had been revised up by the same amount for 2026, reflecting the lagged indirect effects of the past depreciation of the euro as well as higher energy inflation in 2025.

Geopolitical uncertainties loomed over the global growth outlook. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for global composite output excluding the euro area had declined in January to 52.0, amid a broad-based slowdown in the services sector across key economies. The discussions between the United States and Russia over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as the de-escalation in the Middle East, had likely contributed to the recent decline in oil and gas prices on global commodity markets. Nevertheless, geopolitical tensions remained a major source of uncertainty. Euro area foreign demand growth was projected to moderate, declining from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and then to 3.1% in 2026 and 2027. Downward revisions to the projections for global trade compared with the December 2024 projections reflected mostly the impact of tariffs on US imports from China.

The euro had remained stable in nominal effective terms and had appreciated against the US dollar since the last monetary policy meeting. From the start of the easing cycle last summer, the euro had depreciated overall both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, albeit showing a lot of volatility in the high frequency data. Energy commodity prices had decreased following the January meeting, with oil prices down by 4.6% and gas prices down by 12%. However, energy markets had also seen a lot of volatility recently.

Turning to activity in the euro area, GDP had grown modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. Manufacturing was still a drag on growth, as industrial activity remained weak in the winter months and stood below its third-quarter level. At the same time, survey indicators for manufacturing had been improving and indicators for activity in the services sector were moderating, while remaining in expansionary territory. Although growth in domestic demand had slowed in the fourth quarter, it remained clearly positive. In contrast, exports had likely continued to contract in the fourth quarter. Survey data pointed to modest growth momentum in the first quarter of 2025. The composite output PMI had stood at 50.2 in February, unchanged from January and up from an average of 49.3 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The PMI for manufacturing output had risen to a nine-month high of 48.9, whereas the PMI for services business activity had been 50.6, remaining in expansionary territory but at its lowest level for a year. The more forward-looking composite PMI for new orders had edged down slightly in February owing to its services component. The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator had improved in January and February but remained well below its long-term average.

The labour market remained robust. Employment had increased by 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.2% in January. However, demand for labour had moderated, which was reflected in fewer job postings, fewer job-to-job transitions and declining quit intentions for wage or career reasons. Recent survey data suggested that employment growth had been subdued in the first two months of 2025.

In terms of fiscal policy, a tightening of 0.9 percentage points of GDP had been achieved in 2024, mainly because of the reversal of inflation compensatory measures and subsidies. In the March projections a further slight tightening was foreseen for 2025, but this did not yet factor in the news received earlier in the week about the scaling-up of defence spending.

Looking ahead, growth should be supported by higher incomes and lower borrowing costs. According to the staff projections, exports should also be boosted by rising global demand as long as trade tensions did not escalate further. But uncertainty had increased and was likely to weigh on investment and exports more than previously expected. Consequently, ECB staff had again revised down growth projections, by 0.2 percentage points to 0.9% for 2025 and by 0.2 percentage points to 1.2% for 2026, while keeping the projection for 2027 unchanged at 1.3%. Respondents to the Survey of Monetary Analysts expected growth of 0.8% in 2025, 0.2 percentage points lower than in January, but continued to expect growth of 1.1% in 2026 and 1.2% in 2027, unchanged from January.

Market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the January meeting but had risen over recent days in response to the latest fiscal developments. The past interest rate cuts, together with anticipated future cuts, were making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households, and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, a headwind to the easing of financing conditions was coming from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remained subdued overall. The cost of new loans to firms had declined further by 12 basis points to 4.2% in January, about 1 percentage point below the October 2023 peak. By contrast, the cost of issuing market-based corporate debt had risen to 3.7%, 0.2 percentage points higher than in December. Mortgage rates were 14 basis points lower at 3.3% in January, around 80 basis points below their November 2023 peak. However, the average cost of bank credit measured on the outstanding stock of loans had declined substantially less than that of new loans to firms and only marginally for mortgages.

Annual growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December. This had mainly reflected base effects, as the negative flow in January 2024 had dropped out of the annual calculation. Corporate debt issuance had increased in January in terms of the monthly flow, but the annual growth rate had remained broadly stable at 3.4%. Mortgage lending had continued its gradual rise, with an annual growth rate of 1.3% in January after 1.1% in December.

Monetary policy considerations and policy options

In summary, the disinflation process remained well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff expected, and the latest projections closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth was moderating as expected. The recent interest rate cuts were making new borrowing less expensive and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, past interest rate hikes were still transmitting to the stock of credit and lending remained subdued overall. The economy faced continued headwinds, reflecting lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of past rate hikes continued to be the key drivers underpinning the expected pick-up in demand over time.

Based on this assessment, Mr Lane proposed lowering the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the proposal to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was rooted in the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.

Moving the deposit facility rate from 2.75% to 2.50% would be a robust decision. In particular, holding at 2.75% could weaken the required recovery in consumption and investment and thereby risk undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. Furthermore, the new projections indicated that, if the baseline dynamics for inflation and economic growth continued to hold, further easing would be required to stabilise inflation at the medium-term target on a sustainable basis. Under this baseline, from a macroeconomic perspective, a variety of rate paths over the coming meetings could deliver the remaining degree of easing. This reinforced the value of a meeting-by-meeting approach, with no pre-commitment to any particular rate path. In the near term, it would allow the Governing Council to take into account all the incoming data between the current meeting and the meeting on 16-17 April, together with the latest waves of the ECB’s surveys, including the bank lending survey, the Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Consumer Expectations Survey.

Moreover, the Governing Council should pay special attention to the unfolding geopolitical risks and emerging fiscal developments in view of their implications for activity and inflation. In particular, compared with the rate paths consistent with the baseline projection, the appropriate rate path at future meetings would also reflect the evolution and/or materialisation of the upside and downside risks to inflation and economic momentum.

As the Governing Council had advanced further in the process of lowering rates from their peak, the communication about the state of transmission in the monetary policy statement should evolve. Mr Lane proposed replacing the “level” assessment that “monetary policy remains restrictive” with the more “directional” statement that “our monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive”. In a similar vein, the Governing Council should replace the reference “financing conditions continue to be tight” with an acknowledgement that “a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall”.

2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions

Economic, monetary and financial analyses

As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane. Global activity at the end of 2024 had been marginally stronger than expected (possibly supported by firms frontloading imports of foreign inputs ahead of potential trade disruptions) and according to the March 2025 ECB staff projections global growth was expected to remain fairly solid overall, while moderating slightly over 2025-27. This moderation came mainly from expected lower growth rates for the United States and China, which were partially compensated for by upward revisions to the outlook for other economies. Euro area foreign demand was seen to evolve broadly in line with global activity over the rest of the projection horizon. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff projections, foreign demand was projected to be slightly weaker over 2025-27. This weakness was seen to stem mainly from lower US imports. Recent data in the United States had come in on the soft side. It was highlighted that the March 2025 projections only incorporated tariffs implemented at the time of the cut-off date (namely US tariffs of 10% on imports from China and corresponding retaliatory tariffs on US exports to China). By contrast, US tariffs that had been suspended or not yet formally announced at the time of the cut-off date were treated as risks to the baseline projections.

Elevated and exceptional uncertainty was highlighted as a key theme for both the external environment and the euro area economy. Current uncertainties were seen as multidimensional (political, geopolitical, tariff-related and fiscal) and as comprising “radical” or “Knightian” elements, in other words a type of uncertainty that could not be quantified or captured well by standard tools and quantitative analysis. In particular, the unpredictable patterns of trade protectionism in the United States were currently having an impact on the outlook for the global economy and might also represent a more lasting regime change. It was also highlighted that, aside from specific, already enacted tariff measures, uncertainty surrounding possible additional measures was creating significant extra headwinds in the global economy.

The impact of US tariffs on trading partners was seen to be clearly negative for activity while being more ambiguous for inflation. For the latter, an upside effect in the short term, partly driven by the exchange rate, might be broadly counterbalanced by downside pressures on prices from lower demand, especially over the medium term. It was underlined that it was challenging to determine, ex ante, the impact of protectionist measures, as this would depend crucially on how the measures were deployed and was likely to be state and scale-dependent, in particular varying with the duration of the protectionist measures and the extent of any retaliatory measures. More generally, a tariff could be seen as a tax on production and consumption, which also involved a wealth transfer from the private to the public sector. In this context, it was underlined that tariffs were generating welfare losses for all parties concerned.

With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane. The overall narrative remained that the economy continued to grow, but in a modest way. Based on Eurostat’s flash release for the euro area (of 14 February) and available country data, year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 appeared broadly in line with what had been expected. However, the composition was somewhat different, with more private and government consumption, less investment and deeply negative net exports. It was mentioned that recent surveys had been encouraging, pointing to a turnaround in the interest rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, with the euro area manufacturing PMI reaching its highest level in 24 months. While developments in services continued to be better than those in manufacturing, survey evidence suggested that momentum in the services sector could be slowing, although manufacturing might become less negative – a pattern of rotation also seen in surveys of the global economy. Elevated uncertainty was undoubtedly a factor holding back firms’ investment spending. Exports were also weak, particularly for capital goods.The labour market remained resilient, however. The unemployment rate in January (6.2%) was at a historical low for the euro area economy, once again better than expected, although the positive momentum in terms of the rate of employment growth appeared to be moderating.

While the euro area economy was still expected to grow in the first quarter of the year, it was noted that incoming data were mixed. Current and forward-looking indicators were becoming less negative for the manufacturing sector but less positive for the services sector. Consumer confidence had ticked up in the first two months of 2025, albeit from low levels, while households’ unemployment expectations had also improved slightly. Regarding investment, there had been some improvement in housing investment indicators, with the housing output PMI having improved measurably, thus indicating a bottoming-out in the housing market, and although business investment indicators remained negative, they were somewhat less so. Looking ahead, economic growth should continue and strengthen over time, although once again more slowly than previously expected. Real wage developments and more affordable credit should support household spending. The outlook for investment and exports remained the most uncertain because it was clouded by trade policy and geopolitical uncertainties.

Broad agreement was expressed with the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Economic growth was expected to continue, albeit at a modest pace and somewhat slower than previously expected. It was noted, however, that the downward revision to economic growth in 2025 was driven in part by carry-over effects from a weak fourth quarter in 2024 (according to Eurostat’s flash release). Some concern was raised that the latest downward revisions to the current projections had come after a sequence of downward revisions. Moreover, other institutions’ forecasts appeared to be notably more pessimistic. While these successive downward revisions to the staff projections had been modest on an individual basis, cumulatively they were considered substantial. At the same time, it was highlighted that negative judgement had been applied to the March projections, notably on investment and net exports among the demand components. By contrast, there had been no significant change in the expected outlook for private consumption, which, supported by real wage growth, accumulated savings and lower interest rates, was expected to remain the main element underpinning growth in economic activity.

While there were some downward revisions to expectations for government consumption, investment and exports, the outlook for each of these components was considered to be subject to heightened uncertainty. Regarding government consumption, recent discussions in the fiscal domain could mean that the slowdown in growth rates of government spending in 2025 assumed in the projections might not materialise after all. These new developments could pose risks to the projections, as they would have an impact on economic growth, inflation and possibly also potential growth, countering the structural weakness observed so far. At the same time, it was noted that a significant rise in the ten-year yields was already being observed, whereas the extra stimulus from military spending would likely materialise only further down the line. Overall, members considered that the broad narrative of a modestly growing euro area economy remained valid. Developments in US trade policies and elevated uncertainty were weighing on businesses and consumers in the euro area, and hence on the outlook for activity.

Private consumption had underpinned euro area growth at the end of 2024. The ongoing increase in real wages, as well as low unemployment, the stabilisation in consumer confidence and saving rates that were still above pre-pandemic levels, provided confidence that a consumption-led recovery was still on track. But some concern was expressed over the extent to which private consumption could further contribute to a pick-up in growth. In this respect, it was argued that moderating real wage growth, which was expected to be lower in 2025 than in 2024, and weak consumer confidence were not promising for a further increase in private consumption. Concerning the behaviour of household savings, it was noted that saving rates were clearly higher than during the pre-pandemic period, although they were projected to decline gradually over the forecast horizon. However, the current heightened uncertainty and the increase in fiscal deficits could imply that higher household savings might persist, partly reflecting “Ricardian” effects (i.e. consumers prone to increase savings in anticipation of higher future taxes needed to service the extra debt). At the same time, it was noted that the modest decline in the saving rate was only one factor supporting the outlook for private consumption.

Regarding investment, a distinction was made between housing and business investment. For housing, a slow recovery was forecast during the course of 2025 and beyond. This was based on the premise of lower interest rates and less negative confidence indicators, although some lag in housing investment might be expected owing to planning and permits. The business investment outlook was considered more uncertain. While industrial confidence was low, there had been some improvement in the past couple of months. However, it was noted that confidence among firms producing investment goods was falling and capacity utilisation in the sector was low and declining. It was argued that it was not the level of interest rates that was currently holding back business investment, but a high level of uncertainty about economic policies. In this context, concern was expressed that ongoing uncertainty could result in businesses further delaying investment, which, if cumulated over time, would weigh on the medium-term growth potential.

The outlook for exports and the direct and indirect impact of tariff measures were a major concern. It was noted that, as a large exporter, particularly of capital goods, the euro area might feel the biggest impact of such measures. Reference was made to scenario calculations that suggested that there would be a significant negative impact on economic growth, particularly in 2025, if the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the euro area currently being threatened were actually implemented. Regarding the specific impact on euro area exports, it was noted that, to understand the potential impact on both activity and prices, a granular level of analysis would be required, as sectors differed in terms of competition and pricing power. Which specific goods were targeted would also matter. Furthermore, while imports from the United States (as a percentage of euro area GDP) had increased over the past decade, those from the rest of the world (China, the rest of Asia and other EU countries) were larger and had increased by more.

Members overall assessed that the labour market continued to be resilient and was developing broadly in line with previous expectations. The euro area unemployment rate remained at historically low levels and well below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. The strength of the labour market was seen as attenuating the social cost of the relatively weak economy as well as supporting upside pressures on wages and prices. While there had been some slowdown in employment growth, this also had to be seen in the context of slowing labour force growth. Furthermore, the latest survey indicators suggested a broad stabilisation rather than any acceleration in the slowdown. Overall, the euro area labour market remained tight, with a negative unemployment gap.

Against this background, members reiterated that fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It was noted that recent discussions at the national and EU levels raised the prospect of a major change in the fiscal stance, notably in the euro area’s largest economy but also across the European Union. In the baseline projections, which had been finalised before the recent discussions, a fiscal tightening over 2025-27 had been expected owing to a reversal of previous subsidies and termination of the Next Generation EU programme in 2027. Current proposals under discussion at the national and EU levels would represent a substantial change, particularly if additional measures beyond extra defence spending were required to achieve the necessary political buy-in. It was noted, however, that not all countries had sufficient fiscal space. Hence it was underlined that governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and should prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. It was also reiterated that the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provided a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals should be swiftly adopted.

In light of exceptional uncertainty around trade policies and the fiscal outlook, it was noted that one potential impact of elevated uncertainty was that the baseline scenario was becoming less likely to materialise and risk factors might suddenly enter the baseline. Moreover, elevated uncertainty could become a persistent fact of life. It was also considered that the current uncertainty was of a different nature to that normally considered in the projection exercises and regular policymaking. In particular, uncertainty was not so much about how certain variables behaved within the model (or specific model parameters) but whether fundamental building blocks of the models themselves might have to be reconsidered (also given that new phenomena might fall entirely outside the realm of historical data or precedent). This was seen as a call for new approaches to capture uncertainty.

Against this background, members assessed that even though some previous downside risks had already materialised, the risks to economic growth had increased and remained tilted to the downside. An escalation in trade tensions would lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Ongoing uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remained a major source of uncertainty. Growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening lasted longer than expected. At the same time, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allowed domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could also add to growth. For the near-term outlook, the ECB’s mechanical updates of growth expectations in the first half of 2025 suggested some downside risk. Beyond the near term, it was noted that the baseline projections only included tariffs (and retaliatory measures) already implemented but not those announced or threatened but not yet implemented. The materialisation of additional tariff measures would weigh on euro area exports and investment as well as add to the competitiveness challenges facing euro area businesses. At the same time, the potential fiscal impulse had not been included either.

With regard to price developments, members largely agreed that the disinflation process was on track, with inflation continuing to develop broadly as staff had expected. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a delay. However, recent wage negotiations pointed to an ongoing moderation in labour cost pressures, with a lower contribution from profits partially buffering their impact on inflation and most indicators of underlying inflation pointing to a sustained return of inflation to target. Preliminary indicators for labour cost growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 suggested a further moderation, which gave some greater confidence that moderating wage growth would support the projected disinflation process.

It was stressed that the annual growth of compensation per employee, which, based on available euro area data, had stood at 4.4% in the third quarter of 2024, should be seen as the most important and most comprehensive measure of wage developments. According to the projections, it was expected to decline substantially by the end of 2025, while available hard data on wage growth were still generally coming in above 4%, and indications from the ECB wage tracker were based only on a limited number of wage agreements for the latter part of 2025. The outlook for wages was seen as a key element for the disinflation path foreseen in the projections, and the sustainable return of inflation to target was still subject to considerable uncertainty. In this context, some concern was expressed that relatively tight labour markets might slow the rate of moderation and that weak labour productivity growth might push up the rate of increase in unit labour costs.

With respect to the incoming data, members reiterated that hard data for the first quarter would be crucial for ascertaining further progress with disinflation, as foreseen in the staff projections. The differing developments among the main components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) were noted. Energy prices had increased but were volatile, and some of the increases had already been reversed most recently. Notwithstanding the increases in the annual rate of change in food prices, momentum in this salient component was down. Developments in the non-energy industrial goods component remained modest. Developments in services were the main focus of discussions. While some concerns were expressed that momentum in services appeared to have remained relatively elevated or had even edged up (when looking at three-month annualised growth rates), it was also argued that the overall tendency was clearly down. It was stressed that detailed hard data on services inflation over the coming months would be key and would reveal to what extent the projected substantial disinflation in services in the first half of 2025 was on track.

Regarding the March inflation projections, members commended the improved forecasting performance in recent projection rounds. It was underlined that the 0.2 percentage point upward revision to headline inflation for 2025 primarily reflected stronger energy price dynamics compared with the December projections. Some concern was expressed that inflation was now only projected to reach 2% on a sustained basis in early 2026, rather than in the course of 2025 as expected previously. It was also noted that, although the baseline scenario had been broadly materialising, uncertainties had been increasing substantially in several respects. Furthermore, recent data releases had seen upside surprises in headline inflation. However, it was remarked that the latest upside revision to the headline inflation projections had been driven mainly by the volatile prices of crude oil and natural gas, with the decline in those prices since the cut-off date for the projections being large enough to undo much of the upward revision. In addition, it was underlined that the projections for HICP inflation excluding food and energy were largely unchanged, with staff projecting an average of 2.2% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026. The argument was made that the recent revisions showed once again that it was misleading to mechanically relate lower growth to lower inflation, given the prevalence of supply-side shocks.

With respect to inflation expectations, reference was made to the latest market-based inflation fixings, which were typically highly sensitive to the most recent energy commodity price developments. Beyond the short term, inflation fixings were lower than the staff projections. Attention was drawn to a sharp increase in the five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead following the latest expansionary fiscal policy announcements. However, it was argued that this measure remained consistent with genuine expectations broadly anchored around 2% if estimated risk premia were taken into account, and there had been a less substantial adjustment in nearer-term inflation compensation. Looking at other sources of evidence on expectations, collected before the fiscal announcements (as was the case for all survey evidence), panellists in the Survey of Monetary Analysts saw inflation close to 2%. Consumer inflation expectations from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey were generally at higher levels, but they showed a small downtick for one-year ahead expectations. It was also highlighted that firms mentioned inflation in their earnings calls much less frequently, suggesting inflation was becoming less salient.

Against this background, members saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Increasing friction in global trade was adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. A general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise, which would put upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports as a result of higher tariffs and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put downward pressure on inflation. Geopolitical tensions created two-sided inflation risks as regards energy markets, consumer confidence and business investment. Extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increased by more than expected. A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand. But inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected. The view was expressed that the prospect of significantly higher fiscal spending, together with a potentially significant increase in inflation in the event of a tariff scenario with retaliation, deserved particular consideration in future risk assessments. Moreover, the risks might be exacerbated by potential second-round effects and upside wage pressures in an environment where inflation had not yet returned to target and the labour market remained tight. In particular, it was argued that the boost to domestic demand from fiscal spending would make it easier for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers rather than absorb them in their profits, at a time when inflation expectations were more fragile and firms had learned to rapidly adapt the frequency of repricing in an environment of high uncertainty. It was argued that growth concerns were mainly structural in nature and that monetary policy was ineffective in resolving structural weaknesses.

Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the Governing Council’s January meeting, before surging in the days immediately preceding the March meeting. Long-term bond yields had risen significantly: for example, the yield on ten-year German government bonds had increased by about 30 basis points in a day – the highest one-day jump since the surge linked to German reunification in March 1990. These moves probably reflected a mix of expectations of higher average policy rates in the future and a rise in the term premium, and represented a tightening of financing conditions. The revised outlook for fiscal policy – associated in particular with the need to increase defence spending – and the resulting increase in aggregate demand were the main drivers of these developments and had also led to an appreciation of the euro.

Looking back over a longer period, it was noted that broader financial conditions had already been easing substantially since late 2023 because of factors including monetary policy easing, the stock market rally and the recent depreciation of the euro until the past few days. In this respect, it was mentioned that, abstracting from the very latest developments, after the strong increase in long-term rates in 2022, yields had been more or less flat, albeit with some volatility. However, it was contended that the favourable impact on debt financing conditions of the decline in short-term rates had been partly offset by the recent significant increase in long-term rates. Moreover, debt financing conditions remained relatively tight compared with longer-term historical averages over the past ten to 15 years, which covered the low-interest period following the financial crisis. Wider financial markets appeared to have become more optimistic about Europe and less optimistic about the United States since the January meeting, although some doubt was raised as to whether that divergence was set to last.

The ECB’s interest rate cuts were gradually contributing to an easing of financing conditions by making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. The average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to 4.2% in January, from 4.4% in December. Over the same period the average interest rate on new mortgages had fallen to 3.3%, from 3.4%. At the same time, lending rates were proving slower to turn around in real terms, so there continued to be a headwind to the easing of financing conditions from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit. This meant that lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans had only declined marginally, especially for mortgages. The recent substantial increase in long-term yields could also have implications for lending conditions by affecting bank funding conditions and influencing the cost of loans linked to long-term yields. However, it was noted that it was no surprise that financing conditions for households and firms still appeared tight when compared with the period of negative interest rates, because longer-term fixed rate loans taken out during the low-interest rate period were being refinanced at higher interest rates. Financing conditions were in any case unlikely to return to where they had been prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation surge. Furthermore, the most recent bank lending survey pointed to neutral or even stimulative effects of the general level of interest rates on bank lending to firms and households. Overall, it was observed that financing conditions were at present broadly as expected in a cycle in which interest rates would have been cut by 150 basis points according to the proposal, having previously been increased by 450 basis points.

As for lending volumes, loan growth was picking up, but lending remained subdued overall. Growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December, on the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans. Growth in debt securities issued by firms had risen to 3.4% in annual terms. Mortgage lending had continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.3%, up from 1.1% in December.

Underlying momentum in bank lending remained strong, with the three-month and six-month annualised growth rates standing above the annual growth rate. At the same time, it was contended that the recent uptick in bank lending to firms mainly reflected a substitution from market-based financing in response to the higher cost of debt security financing, so that the overall increase in corporate borrowing had been limited. Furthermore, lending was increasing from quite low levels, and the stock of bank loans to firms relative to GDP remained lower than 25 years ago. Nonetheless, the growth of credit to firms was now roughly back to pre-pandemic levels and more than three times the average during the 2010s, while mortgage credit growth was only slightly below the average in that period. On the household side, it was noted that the demand for housing loans was very strong according to the bank lending survey, with the average increase in demand in the last two quarters of 2024 being the highest reported since the start of the survey. This seemed to be a natural consequence of lower interest rates and suggested that mortgage lending would keep rising. However, consumer credit had not really improved over the past year.

Strong bank balance sheets had been contributing to the recovery in credit, although it was observed that non-performing and “stage 2” loans – those loans associated with a significant increase in credit risk – were increasing. The credit dynamics that had been picking up also suggested that the decline in excess liquidity held by banks as reserves with the Eurosystem was not adversely affecting banks’ lending behaviour. This was to be expected since banks’ liquidity coverage ratios were high, and it was underlined that banks could in any case post a wide range of collateral to obtain liquidity from the ECB at any time.

Monetary policy stance and policy considerations

Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function. These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.

Starting with the inflation outlook, members noted that inflation had continued to develop broadly as expected, with incoming data largely in line with the previous projections. Indeed, the central scenario had broadly materialised for several successive quarters, with relatively limited changes in the inflation projections. This was again the case in the March projections, which were closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Inflation expectations had remained well anchored despite the very high uncertainty, with most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continuing to stand at around 2%. This suggested that inflation remained on course to stabilise at the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Still, this continued to depend on the materialisation of the projected material decline in wage growth over the course of 2025 and on a swift and significant deceleration in services inflation in the coming months. And, while services inflation had declined in February, its momentum had yet to show conclusive signs of a stable downward trend.

It was widely felt that the most important recent development was the significant increase in uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation, which could unfold in either direction. There were many unknowns, notably related to tariff developments and global geopolitical developments, and to the outlook for fiscal policies linked to increased defence and other spending. The latter had been reflected in the sharp moves in long-term yields and the euro exchange rate in the days preceding the meeting, while energy prices had rebounded. This meant that, while the baseline staff projection was still a reasonable anchor, a lower probability should be attached to that central scenario than in normal times. In this context, it was argued that such uncertainty was much more fundamental and important than the small revisions that had been embedded in the staff inflation projections. The slightly higher near-term profile for headline inflation in the staff projections was primarily due to volatile components such as energy prices and the exchange rate. Since the cut-off date for the projections, energy prices had partially reversed their earlier increases. With the economy now in the flat part of the disinflation process, small adjustments in the inflation path could lead to significant shifts in the precise timing of when the target would be reached. Overall, disinflation was seen to remain well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff had expected and the latest projections closedly aligned with the previous inflation outlook. At the same time, it was widely acknowledged that risks and uncertainty had clearly increased.

Turning to underlying inflation, members concurred that most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Core inflation was coming down and was projected to decline further as a result of a further easing in labour cost pressures and the continued downward pressure on prices from the past monetary policy tightening. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and prices of certain services were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. However, while the continuing strength of the labour market and the potentially large fiscal expansion could both add to future wage pressures, there were many signs that wage growth was moderating as expected, with lower profits partially buffering the impact on inflation.

Regarding the transmission of monetary policy, recent credit dynamics showed that monetary policy transmission was working, with both the past tightening and recent interest rate cuts feeding through smoothly to market interest rates, financing conditions, including bank lending rates, and credit flows. Gradual and cautious rate cuts had contributed substantially to the progress made towards a sustainable return of inflation to target and ensured that inflation expectations remained anchored at 2%, while securing a soft landing of the economy. The ECB’s monetary policy had supported increased lending. Looking ahead, lags in policy transmission suggested that, overall, credit growth would probably continue to increase.

The impact of financial conditions on the economy was discussed. In particular, it was argued that the level of interest rates and possible financing constraints – stemming from the availability of both internal and external funds – might be weighing on corporate investment. At the same time, it was argued that structural factors contributed to the weakness of investment, including high energy and labour costs, the regulatory environment and increased import competition, and high uncertainty, including on economic policy and the outlook for demand. These were seen as more important factors than the level of interest rates in explaining the weakness in investment. Consumption also remained weak and the household saving rate remained high, though this could also be linked to elevated uncertainty rather than to interest rates.

On this basis, the view was expressed that it was no longer clear whether monetary policy continued to be restrictive. With the last rate hike having been 18 months previously, and the first cut nine months previously, it was suggested that the balance was increasingly shifting towards the transmission of rate cuts. In addition, although quantitative tightening was operating gradually and smoothly in the background, the stock of asset holdings was still compressing term premia and long-term rates, while the diminishing compression over time implied a tightening.

Monetary policy decisions and communication

Against this background, almost all members supported the proposal by Mr Lane to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Lowering the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was justified by the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.

Looking ahead, the point was made that the likely shocks on the horizon, including from escalating trade tensions, and uncertainty more generally, risked significantly weighing on growth. It was argued that these factors could increase the risk of undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. In addition, it was argued that the recent appreciation of the euro and the decline in energy prices since the cut-off date for the staff projections, together with the cooling labour market and well-anchored inflation expectations, mitigated concerns about the upward revision to the near-term inflation profile and upside risks to inflation more generally. From this perspective, it was argued that being prudent in the face of uncertainty did not necessarily equate to being gradual in adjusting the interest rate.

By contrast, it was contended that high levels of uncertainty, including in relation to trade policies, fiscal policy developments and sticky services and domestic inflation, called for caution in policy-setting and especially in communication. Inflation was no longer foreseen to return to the 2% target in 2025 in the latest staff projections and the date had now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2026. Moreover, the latest revision to the projected path meant that inflation would by that time have remained above target for almost five years. This concern would be amplified should upside risks to inflation materialise and give rise to possible second-round effects. For example, a significant expansion of fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending would increase price pressures. This had the potential to derail the disinflation process and keep inflation higher for longer. Indeed, investors had immediately reacted to the announcements in the days preceding the meeting. This was reflected in an upward adjustment of the market interest rate curve, dialling back the number of expected rate cuts, and a sharp increase in five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead. The combination of US tariffs and retaliation measures could also pose upside risks to inflation, especially in the near term. Moreover, firms had also learned to raise their prices more quickly in response to new inflationary shocks.

Against this background, a few members stressed that they could only support the proposal to reduce interest rates by a further 25 basis points if there was also a change in communication that avoided any indication of future cuts or of the future direction of travel, which was seen as akin to providing forward guidance. One member abstained, as the proposed communication did not drop any reference to the current monetary policy stance being restrictive.

In this context, members discussed in more detail the extent to which monetary policy could still be described as restrictive following the proposed interest rate cut. While it was clear that, with each successive rate cut, monetary policy was becoming less restrictive and closer to most estimates of the natural or neutral rate of interest, different views were expressed in this regard.

On the one hand, it was argued that it was no longer possible to be confident that monetary policy was restrictive. It was noted that, following the proposed further cut of 25 basis points, the level of the deposit facility rate would be roughly equal to the current level of inflation. Even after the increase in recent days, long-term yields remained very modest in real terms. Credit and equity risk premia continued to be fairly contained and the euro was not overvalued despite the recent appreciation. There were also many indications in lending markets that the degree of policy restriction had declined appreciably. Credit was responding to monetary policy broadly as expected, with the tightening effect of past rate hikes now gradually giving way to the easing effects of the subsequent rate cuts, which had been transmitting smoothly to market and bank lending rates. This shifting balance was likely to imply a continued move towards easier credit conditions and a further recovery in credit flows. In addition, subdued growth could not be taken as evidence that policy was restrictive, given that the current weakness was seen by firms as largely structural.

In this vein, it was also noted that a deposit facility rate of 2.50% was within, or at least at around the upper bound of, the range of Eurosystem staff estimates for the natural or neutral interest rate, with reference to the recently published Economic Bulletin box, entitled “Natural rate estimates for the euro area: insights, uncertainties and shortcomings”. Using the full array of models and ignoring estimation uncertainty, this currently ranged from 1.75% to 2.75%. Notwithstanding important caveats and the uncertainties surrounding the estimates, it was contended that they still provided a guidepost for the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness. Moreover, while recognising the high model uncertainty, it was argued that both model-based and market-based measures suggested that one main driver of the notable increase in the neutral interest rate over the past three years had been the increased net supply of government bonds. In this context, it was suggested that the impending expansionary fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending – and the likely associated increase in the excess supply of bonds – would affect real interest rates and probably lead to a persistent and significant increase in the neutral interest rate. This implied that, for a given policy rate, monetary policy would be less restrictive.

On the other hand, it was argued that monetary policy would still be in restrictive territory even after the proposed interest rate cut. Inflation was on a clear trajectory to return to the 2% medium-term target while the euro area growth outlook was very weak. Consumption and investment remained weak despite high employment and past wage increases, consumer confidence continued to be low and the household saving ratio remained at high levels. This suggested an economy in stagnation – a sign that monetary policy was still in restrictive territory. Expansionary fiscal policy also had the potential to increase asset swap spreads between sovereign bond and OIS markets. With a greater sovereign bond supply, that intermediation spread would probably widen, which would contribute to tighter financing conditions. In addition, it was underlined that the latest staff projections were conditional on a market curve that implied about three further rate cuts, indicating that a 2.50% deposit facility rate was above the level necessary to sustainably achieve the 2% target in the medium term. It was stressed, in this context, that the staff projections did not hinge on assumptions about the neutral interest rate.

More generally, it was argued that, while the natural or neutral rate could be a useful concept when policy rates were very far away from it and there was a need to communicate the direction of travel, it was of little value for steering policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis. This was partly because its level was fundamentally unobservable, and so it was subject to significant model and parameter uncertainty, a wide range between minimum and maximum estimates, and changing estimates over time. The range of estimates around the midpoint and the uncertainty bands around each estimate underscored why it was important to avoid excessive focus on any particular value. Rather, it was better to simply consider what policy setting was appropriate at any given point in time to meet the medium-term inflation target in light of all factors and shocks affecting the economy, including structural elements. To the extent that consideration should be given to the natural or neutral interest rate, it was noted that the narrower range of the most reliable staff estimates, between 1.75% and 2.25%, indicated that monetary policy was still restrictive at a deposit facility rate of 2.50%. Overall, while there had been a measurable increase in the natural interest rate since the pandemic, it was argued that it was unlikely to have reached levels around 2.5%.

Against this background, the proposal by Mr Lane to change the wording of the monetary policy statement by replacing “monetary policy remains restrictive” with “monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive” was widely seen as a reasonable compromise. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that, after a sustained sequence of rate reductions, the policy rate was undoubtedly less restrictive than at earlier stages in the current easing phase, but it had entered a range in which it was harder to determine the precise level of restrictiveness. In this regard, “meaningfully” was seen as an important qualifier, as monetary policy had already become less restrictive with the first rate cut in June 2024. On the other hand, while interest rates had already been cut substantially, the formulation did not rule out further cuts, even if the scale and timing of such cuts were difficult to determine ex ante.

On the whole, it was considered important that the amended language should not be interpreted as sending a signal in either direction for the April meeting, with both a cut and a pause on the table, depending on incoming data. The proposed change in the communication was also seen as a natural progression from the previous change, implemented in December. This had removed the intention to remain “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary” and shifted to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance, on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on incoming data. From this perspective there was no need to identify the neutral interest rate, particularly given that future policy might need to be above, at or below neutral, depending on the inflation and growth outlook.

Looking ahead, members reiterated that the Governing Council remained determined to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. Its interest rate decisions would continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Uncertainty was particularly high and rising owing to increasing friction in global trade, geopolitical developments and the design of fiscal policies to support increased defence and other spending. This underscored the importance of following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.

Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

It’s an odd situation legally, because a majority of the board of trustees resigned in protest, as did Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso. Harry and Seeiso’s side has let it be known that they “expected” Chandauka’s “publicity stunt” interviews and her wild, nonsensical allegations. But would anything happen beyond what amounts to a PR war? Well, the UK’s Charity Commission is now investigating the situation, and Prince Harry and Sophie Chandauka released new statements:

The Charity Commission is to investigate the bitter dispute that led to the Duke of Sussex and several others resigning from the charity he co-founded. The watchdog said it had opened a case to examine “concerns raised” about Sentebale, following claims made by its head Sophie Chandauka.

Ms Chandauka told the BBC she welcomed the move by the commission, which comes after she said she had “blown the whistle” on issues including bullying and harassment, and warned of the prince’s “toxicity” for the charity.

Prince Harry said: “What has transpired over the last week has been heartbreaking to witness, especially when such blatant lies hurt those who have invested decades in this shared goal.”

The duke, speaking on behalf of the former trustees and patrons, welcomed the watchdog’s announcement, saying it would be a “robust inquiry” which “we fully expect will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign”.

“We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve,” said the prince.

The Charity Commission’s “regulatory compliance case” is the first step in assessing the complaints and allegations over what has happened at Sentebale, which was founded in 2006 to help children in southern Africa affected by HIV and Aids.

A statement from the watchdog said it was “in direct contact with parties who have raised concerns” and would gather evidence to see whether those running the charity, past and present, had complied with their “duties and responsibilities under charity law”.

“From the inception of Sentebale nearly 20 years ago, Prince Seeiso and I have had a clear goal – to support the children and young people in southern Africa in memory of our mothers,” said Prince Harry, responding to the charity watchdog’s announcement.

On Thursday, Ms Chandauka said in a statement that the concerns brought to the commission included “governance, administration and management matters”. The Sentebale head said she hoped the public and donors would now see there was a new board of trustees “acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture”.",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:37.136694

According to the White House, it “shall focus on delivering the benefit of the bargain for taxpayers by negotiating much better deals than those of the previous administration.”

The order did not detail how this would affect already existing contracts and awards.

There were hints that Trump did not like President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act strategy to get semiconductor investments into the U.S. during his campaign. This became crystal clear in his first address to Congress in March, when he told the House Speaker to “get rid of the CHIPS Act” and spend the money for it to “reduce debt or any other reason you want to.”

Aside from this, the federal government staff purge hit the CHIPS Act office just a few days before the speech, with at least two-fifths of the current staff reportedly terminated.

The White House started reviewing CHIPS Act awards in February; some people familiar with the matter said the new administration wanted to renegotiate the terms enforced under the deal to “align with President Trump’s executive orders and policies.” It’s still unclear how these reviews will affect CHIPS Act winners, but scheduled fund disbursements are expected to be delayed.

Still, it’s not all bad news for the semiconductor industry. The setting up of the U.S. Investment Accelerator office implies that the White House is seemingly continuing with the CHIPS Act and that companies that expect to receive subsidies aren’t going to be completely stiffed by the new administration.

Furthermore, the executive order also directs it to assist investors for efficiency, reduce regulations, increase access to and use of national resources, facilitate research, and reduce regulatory barriers to increase investment in the United States. This new office is designed not just to release new federal funding for semiconductor investments but also to use the existing frameworks in Federal law so that anyone investing in the U.S. can take advantage of them.

Despite Trump’s criticism of the CHIPS Act, he still understands the importance of the semiconductor industry. He even had TSMC announce an additional $100 billion investment in its Arizona plant in the White House, while Congress introduced an act that would give tax credits to chip designers. The current administration says that the most advanced AI chips will be built in the U.S., and the U.S. Investment Accelerator office will likely pave the way to help massive tech companies achieve that within its borders.",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:39.883569

1

The consultation sets out remedies to require the card scheme operators to increase transparency on fees to merchants and acquirers, and requirements on pricing governance and regulatory reporting to the PSR.



In its recent market review, the PSR found that between 2017 and 2023 Visa and Mastercard raised their core scheme and processing fees by more than 25% in real terms representing an extra cost of at least £170million per year for UK businesses. The review also criticised the card schemes for not providing sufficiently clear or detailed information, resulting in merchants and acquirers receiving incomplete or complex information on fees.



David Geale, managing director of the PSR says: “The proposed remedies we have set out today are a clear way to address the findings in our final report that this market is not working well for businesses and ultimately consumers.



“Improving transparency will enable businesses to make informed choices about the card payment services they receive. These steps will also ensure we can scrutinise the performance of the card schemes and act quickly in the future if we need to take further action.”



The British Retail Consortium has hit out at the proposals, describing them as ""falling well short"" of what is needed to fix the problems that exist.



Chris Owen, payments policy advisor at the merchant lobby group says: “Today’s consultation represents a failure of vision by the PSR. Their proposed remedies fall well short of the robust measures needed to tackle the harms that have arisen from the dominance of the card scheme operators.



""The PSR must act on its regulatory responsibilities and use its powers to mandate pricing interventions and a longer-term price cap to meaningfully lower fees and bring lasting reform to the market. Otherwise, the card schemes will continue to exploit their dominance, and retailers - and their customers - will continue to pay the price.”",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:43.704463

US President Donald Trump holds a reciprocal tariffs poster during a tariff announcement in the Rose ... More Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Photographer: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg Updated, Apr. 3, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the tariff rates for Japan (24%) and Vietnam (46%). President Donald Trump surprised global markets with his much-anticipated announcement of sweeping import tariffs. While most investors expected the White House to implement reciprocal tariff rates, the final plan resembled a worst-case scenario. The tariffs were significantly higher than anticipated, leaving investors worried about the implications. The executive order outlined both a universal tariff of 10% and a country-by-country tariff with some exemptions. Rates will apply uniformly to all non-exempt products rather than varying by product and were based on perceived total trade barriers for each country. Total trade barriers include actual tariff rates plus non-tariff measures that can impact the level of trade. Non-tariff barriers are rules or policies that make it harder for countries to trade goods without directly applying a tax. These barriers can include import quotas, licensing requirements, quality standards, packaging and labeling rules, or customs delays. As a proxy for the total trade barriers, the Council of Economic Advisers calculated rates using a formula primarily based on the U.S. trade deficit with each country. The methodology divided the trade deficit by the total value of imports from that country and then halved the result. For example, if a country had a $100 billion trade deficit with the U.S. and exported $200 billion worth of goods to the U.S., the formula would yield a 25% tariff rate. “Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,” the executive order stated. It appears the White House is defining reciprocal trade in terms of the size of the trade deficit. If there is a trade deficit, the administration points to non-tariff barriers. In his speech, President Trump referred to the 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, which is published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The report provides a detailed analysis of the trade barriers faced by American exporters. Given their large trade deficits with the United States, Asian countries were among the hardest hit. Below is a brief analysis of some of the non-tariff barriers cited in the report, which the administration used to justify the high tariff rates on China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. For each country, the new tariff rate and the potential impact on the average American are listed. It is important to note that the extent of retaliation from these countries is still unknown. 1. Intellectual Property Rights: Despite reforms, China still faces criticism for weak enforcement of IP laws. U.S. companies suffer from patent infringement, counterfeit goods, and inadequate legal protection. 2. Industrial Policy Discrimination: China provides subsidies and incentives to local firms, often excluding or limiting access to foreign competitors. 3. Market Access Limits: U.S. firms face strict licensing rules in cloud computing, banking, and digital services, where U.S. firms are global leaders. 4. Agricultural Restrictions: U.S. beef, poultry, and genetically modified crop exporters face long approval delays and standards that aren’t always scientifically justified. Higher tariffs on Chinese imports could raise prices on various consumer goods, from electronics to clothing. Many of these items are assembled or manufactured in China, meaning cost increases could be passed down to U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, U.S. exporters of agricultural and tech goods might see reduced demand, which could impact American farmers and tech workers if China retaliates. 1. Unique Automotive Standards: U.S. vehicles must often undergo expensive modifications to meet Japanese standards, limiting market entry. 2. Pharmaceuticals And Medical Devices: Japan has long approval timelines and a complex reimbursement process that delays access to U.S. health innovations. 3. Agricultural Import Controls: High quotas and restrictive inspections hinder U.S. rice, beef, and dairy exports. 4. Services Barriers: Insurance and telecom providers face regulatory requirements that favor domestic players. Japan is a major exporter of high-quality automobiles and electronic goods. Tariffs on Japanese imports could mean higher car prices, appliances, and high-end tech prices. American consumers could see price hikes or fewer options at dealerships. On the flip side, U.S. exporters of medical and food products may gain leverage if Japan loosens non-trade barriers to avoid retaliatory duties. 1. Automotive Standards: U.S. auto manufacturers must tailor vehicles to meet Korean safety and emissions regulations. 2. Agricultural Restrictions: Stringent measures that block biotech approvals of U.S. products like corn and soybeans. 3. Opaque Pharmaceutical Pricing: Government-set reimbursement levels can put U.S. drugmakers at a disadvantage. 4. Service Sector Limitations: Foreign legal and telecom services are heavily restricted or require joint ventures. 5. Weak IP Enforcement: Online piracy and counterfeiting remain problematic. South Korea is a major supplier of electronics, cars, and semiconductors. Tariffs on these products could raise prices on TVs, smartphones, and electric vehicles. In addition, U.S. exporters of agricultural products and biotech may be impacted if Korea responds with trade barriers of its own, potentially affecting rural economies dependent on exports. 1. Customs And Valuation Issues: U.S. exporters face delays due to unpredictable customs practices and inconsistent rule enforcement. 2. Technical Barriers To Trade: Divergent electronics, cosmetics, and medical device standards make it harder to sell U.S. products. 3. IP Challenges: Enforcement of copyrights and trademarks is still developing, with pirated goods commonplace in many markets. 4. Investment Limits: Foreign equity caps in sectors like telecom and banking restrict full market participation by U.S. firms. Vietnam has become a go-to manufacturing hub for clothing, shoes, furniture, and electronics. Tariffs on Vietnamese imports could mean higher costs for everyday essentials like apparel, home goods, and consumer technology. The White House believes that tariffs, rate differentials, and non-tariff barriers distort trade and disadvantage American businesses. President Trump’s intention behind the high tariffs is to reshape global trade by addressing longstanding trade imbalances, reducing reliance on imports, and boosting U.S. manufacturing. The goal of the tariffs is to incentivize companies to relocate production to the U.S., creating jobs and strengthening domestic industries in the process. A lack of strength in certain domestic industries would put the U.S. at a strategic geopolitical disadvantage in the event of a prolonged conflict with its largest trading partners, which supply products critical for national security. According to the administration, the only way to solve that problem would be to source and manufacture those products in the U.S. These tariffs will undoubtedly raise much-needed revenue for the federal government but may also have consequences for domestic consumers. From higher prices on smartphones, apparel, and consumer electronics, the average American will likely feel at least some effects of escalating trade tensions. The cost of the tariffs will be absorbed by the exporter, the importer, or the consumer and will vary by product and industry. By implementing reciprocal tariffs, President Trump is trying to level the playing field and generate revenue for the government while signaling a move away from globalization toward economic self-reliance. Now that the tariff policy appears set, the administration's next focus should be on finding ways to ease Americans' costs as trade relationships are redefined. Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana provided a good anecdote on the impact of the tariffs during a CNN interview on March 31. ""There's absolutely going to be short-term pain,"" Sheehy said. ""The president's been clear about that, everyone has. I mean, if you're going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, it's gonna be really annoying in the short-term when your house is getting remodeled.""",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:45.211533

Peter Kyle, the sec","Reactions to the government’s move to include more manager service providers (MSPs) under the scope of the Security and Resilience Bill have started to come in, with distributors and managed service specialists pledging their support for those needing to improve their defences.

Earlier this week, the government shared a Cyber security and resilience policy statement that outlined the need for greater data protection and the impact it would have on managed service providers.

Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for Science, Innovation and Technology, outlined why the changes were happening in the policy statement and the reasons why more MSPs would come under the scope of the legislation.

“MSPs play a critical role in the UK economy by offering core IT services to businesses. These organisations have unprecedented access to clients’ IT systems, networks, infrastructure and data. This makes them an attractive target for malicious actors and subject to cyber attacks, including those that resulted in impacts on clients,” he stated.

“This measure will expand the remit of current regulations by bringing entities who provide managed services into the scope of the regulations. Placing duties on MSPs will enable us to protect a broader range of services from cyber attacks and build a better picture of the threats facing our essential services.

“Expanding the scope of the regulations to include managed services will enhance the security of IT infrastructure and reduce the risks of cyber attack. This measure is estimated to secure a further 900 to 1,100 MSPs. While we expect this measure to have associated costs related to security improvements and compliance, these investments will position MSPs as trusted and reliable partners in the cyber security landscape.”

The reaction from the industry is understanding of the need to protect customers data but aware that for some of those impacted by the Bill it will require investment in skills and policies.

John Nolan, UK & Ireland managing director of Westcon at Westcon-Comstor, said that it recognised it had a role to play in supporting MSPS affected: “As the government itself acknowledges in its policy statement, MSPs play a critical role in the UK economy by providing core IT services to businesses. From the perspective of policymakers, it makes sense to bring MSPs and other supply chain partners into the scope of the regulations as part of efforts to strengthen the security of critical IT infrastructure and reduce the risks of cyber attacks.

“While the increased regulatory burden represents a challenge to the UK’s MSPs in terms of additional costs and compliance requirements, it’s also an opportunity. By demonstrating leadership when it comes to complying with the legislation, MSPs can showcase their expertise to customers and strengthen relationships in the process, positioning themselves – to use the government’s phrase – as ‘trusted and reliable partners’ in the cyber security landscape.

“It is, of course, vital for commercial and reputational reasons that MSPs ensure compliance with the bill. Those that feel they require additional support ahead of the bill becoming law should turn to distributors and other partners for guidance and input as required.”

Max Pruger, general manager audit and compliance suite at Kaseya, was also keen to reach out to the estimated 900 to 1,100 MSPs that would be bought into the scope of the rules laid out in the Network and Information Systems Regulation (NIS) 2018.

“Governments and large corporations are adding cyber security to their supply chain risk management programs. Governments and corporations are no longer tolerating poor risk choices by vendors and are forcing security compliance through contracts and laws,” he said.

He added that it had seen similar moves by the US and Canadian governments and, “it is inevitable that the UK and European business and government leaders will start enforcing minimum security standards, with third-party validation, in their supply chains”.",Regulatory News,Global Compliance,Global,,False,2025-04-04T11:52:48.375211
