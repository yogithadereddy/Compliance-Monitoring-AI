Ninety years ago, the Reserve Bank of India was established to serve as the custodian of India's monetary and financial stability. Over these nine decades, we have evolved, adapting to the changing economic landscape while remaining committed to the economic progress of our nation and the welfare of its people. 4. As we entered the 90th year, exactly one year ago, we initiated the celebrations with the opening ceremony that was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister. Throughout the year, we organized several high-level events on themes such as emerging technologies and Digital Public Infrastructure. The Conference of Central Banks from the Global South reinforced India's thought leadership in the global community and deepened our understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. 5. To engage with the public, we hosted nationwide initiatives such as the RBI@90 Quiz, which received enthusiastic participation from students across the country. We organized an art competition that celebrated the creativity and heritage of India's artistic traditions. Sporting events, town hall meetings, tree plantation drives, and blood donation camps brought together our employees and communities. 6. All these events reinforced the spirit of collaboration and service that define the Reserve Bank. We celebrated our past and reaffirmed our responsibility for the future. We reflected on our achievements and rich legacy and recommitted ourselves to realising the vision of a Viksit Bharat built on a stronger, more stable, and inclusive financial system. 7. As we mark this milestone, we recognize that the Reserve Bank's role has expanded significantly beyond its initial mandate. Today, we stand at the confluence of tradition and transformation, where the imperatives of price stability, financial stability, and economic growth intersect with rapid technological advancements, global uncertainties, challenges of climate change and increasing public expectations. 8. The next decade will be crucial in shaping the financial architecture of our economy. We remain committed to expanding and deepening financial inclusion. We shall strive to foster a culture of continuous improvement in customer services and strengthening customer protection. It will be our endeavour to optimize our regulatory frameworks by balancing the interests of financial stability and efficiency. We will continue to support technology and innovation. We shall remain vigilant, adaptive, and forward-looking. We will continue to collaborate effectively with all stakeholders – governments and financial sector regulators, among others. We will do everything that is required to improve the financial system by expanding its access, enhancing its efficiency, and strengthening its resilience in an evolving economic landscape. 9. Even as we embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches, our core values - integrity, transparency, and commitment to public service - will continue to guide us. The trust that the people of India repose in the Reserve Bank is our greatest asset. We are determined to preserve it and further strengthen it in the years ahead. This institution belongs to the nation. We shall continue to take each and every decision, driven by an unwavering resolve to serve the interests of the people, the financial system, and the economy. 10. As we conclude this year-long celebration and step into our centenary decade, we do so with confidence, determination, and a clear vision. The journey ahead will demand continuous adaptation and agility; fresh thinking and innovation; collaboration and coordination; and an unwavering commitment to excellence and perfection. We, at the Reserve Bank, remain fully prepared to meet all challenges and seize all opportunities, to contribute proactively and vigourously, to India's economic progress. 11.

Chief General Manager Encl: As above MASTER CIRCULAR ON AGENCY COMMISSION Introduction 1. The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in . Government transactions eligible for agency commission 2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI: Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Governments Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments and Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for agency commission 3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India. Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur. 4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business. Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt. 5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e-mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work. 6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above. Government transactions not eligible for agency commission 7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission. 8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission. Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc. through agency banks by government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers. The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies/Municipalities/ companies/ Corporations/Local Bodies. Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies etc. Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government Ministry/Department (in consultation with CGA) or a State Government Department through any bank. Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on the mandate received from the governments. Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or State Government as ineligible for agency commission. 9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI from time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission and submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while claiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions. 10. Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI: After the operationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X7, agency banks authorised to collect Goods and Service Tax (GST), Customs and Central Excise Duties through ICEGATE, Direct Taxes under TIN 2.0 channel shall upload their luggage files in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on all days except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, all non-working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RBI for Government Transactions due to exigencies. It is to be ensured that these luggage files are uploaded in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on or before 1800 hours prescribed by Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs and Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Direct Taxes. No extension in cut-off time will be allowed to agency banks by RBI beyond 1800 hours for uploading of these luggage files in QPX/e-Kuber. 11. The date of monthly balance transfer for the State Government transactions is 5th of the following month. The State Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of previous month reported after 4th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned State government. 12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) or any adjustments thereof, if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of transaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned Ministry/Department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement. Rates for agency commission 13. As per agency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under: Sr. No. Type of Transaction Unit Revised Rate a. (i) Receipts - Physical mode Per transaction ₹40/- (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction ₹9/- b. Pension Payments Per transaction ₹75/- c. Payments other than Pension Per ₹100 turnover 6.5 paise per ₹100 14. In this context, the ‘Receipts-e-mode transactions’ indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter’s bank account through Internet banking as well as such transactions which do not involve physical receipt of cash /instruments at all. For example, challan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode. 15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017. 16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited. Therefore, records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission. 17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension transactions at the rate of ₹75 per transaction only when the entire work relating to disbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them. If the work relating to pension calculations etc. is attended to by the concerned Government Department / Treasury and the banks are required only to credit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under ‘other than pension payment’ and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 paise per ₹100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019. 18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should not exceed 14 per pensioner per year. This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits. 19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages. Where, however, the work is shared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the proportion of 75:25. Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency banks as detailed below: At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e., up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the Pay and Accounts Offices, and treasuries/sub-treasuries. At 75% of the applicable rate, where the dealing branch is required to account for the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank conducting government business. At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the scrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible for the accounting of these transactions and dispatching of the scrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc. 20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in certain cases. So also, for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of State government/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/Treasury. This new arrangement for settlement of State government funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018. Claiming agency commission 21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format (with GST details) to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State Government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt and transactions related to direct tax collection under TIN 2.0 regime, and transactions pertaining to collection of indirect taxes through ICEGATE reported to Mumbai Regional Office, RBI will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all authorized agency banks are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to the respective receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The agency commission claim for Central Government transactions reported to CAS, Nagpur, RBI will be continued to be settled at CAS, Nagpur, RBI. The formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in , and respectively. These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof. 22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, claims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank’s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit. 23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated November 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, centrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been replaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be. 24. For eligible Government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter. 25. However, for eligible Government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto. 26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate. Agency banks may also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate. Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims. 27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to Reserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions have been conducted. If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above, they may forward the same to RBI, only after giving reasons for delay. Penal interest for wrong claims 28. As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-compliance of instructions issued by Government or Reserve Bank shall attract imposition of penalty. Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.

RBI has issued certain instructions in this regard which is available in the . Clarifications, in the form of questions and answers, on certain issues related to the instructions issued by RBI is given below. 1. Whether a Joint Account can be continued for family pension after death of a pensioner? Yes, the banks should not insist on opening of a new account in case of Central Government pensioner if the spouse in whose favour an authorization for family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO) is the survivor. The family pension should be credited to the existing account without opening a new account by the family pensioner for this purpose. 2.

The pension paying banks credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by the Pension Paying Authorities. 3.

(b) Where excess pension payment has arisen on account of mistakes committed by the bank, the amount paid in excess should be refunded to the Government in lump-sum immediately after detection of the same and without waiting for recovery of any amount from the pensioners. 4. Should acknowledgement be given by pension paying banks while accepting Life Certificates from pensioners? There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also requested to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgements in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. 5. Is it possible to submit life certificates without visiting the branch? Yes, pensioners can submit life certificates without visiting the branch using Jeevan Praman provided the Pension Sanctioning Authority is on boarded on the platform. Further, banks have also been advised to provide super senior citizens (pensioners over 70 years of age) and differently abled or infirm persons (having medically certified chronic illness or disability) including those who are visually impaired, the facility to submit life certificate at the premises/ residence of such customers. 6.

Yes, instructions have been issued by RBI to pension disbursing banks to allow withdrawal of pension by following certain procedures which are given below: Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners (i) In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise such pensioners as under: (a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. (b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect / incapacity. (ii) With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under: (a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. (b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account. Agency banks have been asked to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board at the branches so that sick and disabled pensioners can make full use of these facilities. 7. How the payment of Dearness Relief at revised rate is to be paid to the pensioners? The pension paying agency banks have to revise the Dearness Relief based on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing the information from the website of the concerned governments, and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. 8. Whether a pensioner is entitled for any compensation from the agency banks for delayed credit of pension/ arrears of pension? Yes, pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment.

Chief General Manager Encl.: As above Master Circular – Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks Introduction Payment of pension to retired government employees, including payment of basic pension, increased dearness relief (DR), and other benefits, as and when announced by the governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by concerned Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till March 31, 2025 ( ). It does not replace or supersede any existing government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the past will continue to remain in operation subject to changes being made by the competent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarized hereunder. General Instructions Government orders on DR, etc. on websites 2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the procedure of forwarding related government orders in respect of dearness relief etc. to pension disbursing agency banks has been discontinued. Agency banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing from the government websites and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. Prompt implementation of Government’s instructions by agency banks 3. All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines/ instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI. Timing of pension disbursement by agency banks 4. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities. Refund of excess pension payment to Government 5. Whenever any excess/overpayment is detected, the entire amount thereof should be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately, when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is independent of recovery from the pensioner. Agency banks are requested to seek guidance from respective Pension Sanctioning Authorities regarding the process to be followed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any. 6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority’s acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank’s record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India. Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners 7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorize such pensioners as under: Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect /incapacity. 8. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under: Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account. 9. The pensioner may also be asked to indicate to the bank as to who would withdraw the pension amount from the bank on the basis of cheque/ withdrawal form as obtained above and that person should be identified by two independent witnesses. The person who would be actually drawing the money from the bank should be asked to furnish his signature to the bank. 10. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled pensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to strictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and sensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to the on pension disbursement hosted on our website ( ) in case of any doubt. Reimbursement of pension payments 11. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at Regional Office for Central / State Government pension payments respectively. Continuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner 12. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in case the spouse (family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO). Life Certificate- Issuance of Acknowledgement 13. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgments in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. Single Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments 14. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of reimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each pension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims. Customer Service 15. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum include the items given in . Agency banks may also instruct their internal auditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which may be made available to Reserve Bank’s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the branches. 16. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level, especially, after the setting up of Centralized Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular interaction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint one/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at monthly intervals. 17. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress complaints. 18. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing revised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised as under: Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment and the compensation shall be credited to the pensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in respect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008. Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain immediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authorities directly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the Reserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the Governments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself. When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feels disenfranchised. All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in all their dealings with the bank. Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details about pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners through the net or at the branches at periodic intervals, as may be deemed necessary and sufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements. All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payments must be accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business that there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular pension/arrears thereof. All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners who are of old age. Annex 1 Checklist relating to Government Business (pension related) for internal / concurrent audit Internal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner customers. In this regard, the following may be ensured: 1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for use during inspection of pension paying branches. 2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and enquire about their satisfaction with pension-related services. 3. A detailed checklist relating to pension payments/government business may be given by banks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of India, relating to pension payments/government business. These include the following: Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in dearness relief etc. Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of pensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of pensioners of all governments and departments exceeds affixed number, say, 100 or 200. Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts and the status is being indicated on the monthly pension slips issued to the pensioners. Whether pension accounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever applicable. Whether the bank branch has an effective complaint redressal mechanism, and the complaints of pensioners are attended promptly, and their grievances redressed expeditiously. Whether the pension is credited to pensioner’s account during the last four working days of the month except for the month of March for which pension is to be credited on or after first working day of April. Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Certificate/ Non-employment certificate/Employment Certificate from the pensioners in the month of November every year. Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension payments wherever applicable. Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably given by the tax collecting branches. Whether the challans are stamped giving bank’s BSR code and Challan Identification Number (CIN) clearly. Whether the stamped challans are kept in the custody of bank’s staff and handed over to the concerned taxpayer only on production of the paper token.

Such SRs shall be valued periodically by reckoning the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the ARC based on the recovery ratings received for such instruments. However, any unrealised gains recognised in the Profit and Loss Account on account of fair valuation of such investments shall be deducted from CET 1 capital, and no dividends shall be paid out of such unrealized gains. Any SRs outstanding after the final settlement of the government guarantee or the expiry of the guarantee period, whichever is earlier, shall be valued at one rupee (₹1). In the event of the SRs being converted to any other form of instruments as part of resolution, then the valuation and provisioning thereof, for such instruments shall be governed by the provisions as laid down under paragraph 19 of the Annex 1 to the . 3.

Foreign assets of Indian residents declined by US$ 40.1 billion and the claims of non-residents’ in India also declined by US$ 29.1 billion, resulting in increase in the India net foreign liabilities ( ).

The decline in Indian residents’ foreign assets during October-December 2024 was mainly on account of the decrease of US$ 70.1 billion in reserve assets.

Reserve assets, however, recorded an increase of US$ 13.2 billion over December 2023.

The fall in India’s foreign liabilities was due to the decline in inward direct and portfolio investments during the quarter, though trade credit, loans and currency & deposits recorded an increase.

Reserve assets accounted for 59.0 per cent of India’s total international financial assets in December 2024 ( ).

Variation in the exchange rate of rupee vis-a-vis other currencies impacted the change in liabilities, when valued in the US dollar terms.

The ratio of India’s international assets to international liabilities improved to 74.7 per cent in December 2024 from 73.1 per cent a year ago.

The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased to 53.6 per cent in December 2024 from 52.9 per cent a quarter ago and 51.2 per cent a year ago ( ). (Puneet Pancholy)

– Review of Interchange Fee and Customer Charges The Reserve Bank of India had, from time to time, issued various instructions on the number of free ATM transactions and maximum charges that can be levied on a customer beyond the mandatory free transactions. Instructions have also been issued by RBI on interchange fee structure for ATM transactions. Based on a review, it has been decided as under: The ATM interchange fee will be as decided by the ATM network. Customers are eligible for five free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-financial transactions) every month from their own bank ATMs. They are also eligible for free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-financial transactions) from other bank ATMs viz. three transactions in metro centres and five transactions in non-metro centres. Beyond the free transactions, a customer may be charged a maximum fee of ₹23 per transaction. This shall be effective from May 01, 2025. Applicable taxes, if any, shall be additionally payable. These instructions shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to transactions done at Cash Recycler Machines (other than for cash deposit transactions). 2.

Chapter II: Composition of Regulatory Capital 5. Minimum regulatory capital RRBs are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent on an ongoing basis. A bank shall compute CRAR in the following manner: Where, Total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) is calculated as the aggregate of RWAs and other off-balance sheet exposures, as mentioned in paragraph 7 below. 6.

Degrees of credit risk expressed as percentage weightings have been assigned to Balance Sheet assets and conversion factors to off-Balance Sheet items. Banks shall multiply the value of each asset/item by the relevant weights to produce risk-adjusted values of assets and of off-Balance Sheet items. The aggregate shall constitute the total RWAs to be taken into account for computing CRAR. The weights allotted to each category of Balance Sheet assets and off-Balance Sheet items are furnished in the . Chapter IV: Reporting 8.

[Paragraph 6.1.1(h)] Terms and Conditions applicable to Perpetual Debt Instruments to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital The Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) that may be issued as bonds or debentures by RRBs should meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital for capital adequacy purposes: 1. Terms of Issue of PDIs (a) Amount: RRBs shall issue PDI in Indian currency only. The amount of PDI to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks. (b) Paid-in Status: The instruments should be issued by the bank (i.e., not by any ‘SPV’ etc. set up by the bank for this purpose) and fully paid-in. (c) Limits: Within minimum Tier 1 of 7 percent, the PDIs will be limited to 1.5 per cent of the total RWAs. Any additional amount raised through PDIs over and above the 1.5 per cent of the RWAs will also be reckoned as Tier 1 capital provided the bank complies with the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent of RWAs before reckoning such additional amounts. (d) Maturity Period: The instruments shall be Perpetual i.e., there is no maturity date and there are no step-ups or other incentives to redeem. (e) Rate of Interest: (i) The interest payable to the investors shall be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate. (ii) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e., a coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banks’ credit standing. For this purpose, any reference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank’s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider banking sector will be treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. (f) Options: PDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or a 'step-up option'. However, RRBs may issue the instruments with a call option subject to strict compliance with each of the following conditions: (i) Call option shall be exercised only after the instrument has run for minimum five years; and (ii) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of RBI (Department of Regulation). While considering the proposals received from RRBs for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank’s CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option. (g) Lock-In Clause: (i) PDI should be subject to a lock-in clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall not be liable to pay interest, if (a) The bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. Or (b) The impact of such payment results in bank's capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR) falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. (ii) However, RRBs may pay interest with the prior approval of RBI, when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR remains above the regulatory norm. For this purpose, ‘Net Loss’ would mean either (a) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year; or (b) the loss incurred during the current financial year. (iii) The interest shall not be cumulative. (iv) All instances of invocation of the lock-in clause should be notified by the issuing banks to the Chief General Manager, Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India and Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai. (h) Seniority of Claim: The claims of the investors in PDI shall be: Senior to the claims of investors in equity shares; and Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors. (i) Discount: The PDIs shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual. (j) Other Conditions: (i) PDI should be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses. (ii) RRBs should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments. 2. Compliance with Reserve Requirements The total amount raised by a bank through PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements. 3. Reporting Requirements RRBs issuing PDI shall submit a report to Chief General Manager, Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai giving details of the debt raised, including the terms of issue specified at paragraph 1 above, together with a copy of the offer document, soon after the issue is completed. 4. Investment in PDIs (a) RRBs shall not invest in PDI issued by other banks including RRBs. (b) RRBs shall not issue PDI to retail investors/ FPI/ NRIs. 5. Grant of Advances against PDI RRBs should not grant advances against the security of the PDI issued by them. 6.

Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement 8.1 To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit at the district level, it was decided to rank districts on the basis of per capita credit flow to priority sector and build an incentive framework for districts with comparatively lower flow of credit and a dis-incentive framework for districts with comparatively higher flow of priority sector credit. With effect from FY 2024-25, a higher weight (125%) shall be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). The list of both categories of districts is given in and and will be valid up to FY 2026-27, subject to a review thereafter. The districts other than those mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will continue to have normal weightage of 100%. 8.2 The banks shall continue to report the actual outstanding amount in Quarterly Priority Sector Advances (QPSA) returns as hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI, based on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the ADEPT database. RRBs, UCBs, LABs and foreign banks (including Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) would be exempted from adjustments of weights in PSL achievement due to their currently limited area of operation/catering to a niche segment.

Since September 2010 the exercise has become mandatory for jurisdictions with systemically important financial sectors. Currently, it is mandatory for 32 jurisdictions including India, every five years, and for another 15 jurisdictions every ten years. Last FSAP for India was conducted in 2017 and the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was published by IMF on 21st December, 2017. 2. IMF released the latest India-FSSA report on their websites on February 28, 2025, based on the assessment carried out during 2024, while WB’s Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report is due for publication. 3. India welcomes assessment of the Indian financial system undertaken by the joint IMF-World Bank team conforming to the highest international standards. 4. IMF’s FSSA report highlights that India’s financial system has become more resilient and diverse since the last FSAP in 2017, driven by rapid economic growth. Financial Sector in India has shown recovery from various distress episodes of 2010s and withstood the pandemic well. In terms of evolution of financial sector landscape, Non-Banking Financial Intermediaries (NBFI) sector has become diverse but more interconnected. Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have sufficient aggregate capital to support moderate lending even in severe macrofinancial scenarios. 5. On regulation and supervision of NBFCs, IMF acknowledged India’s systematic approach for prudential requirements of NBFCs with scale based regulatory framework. IMF appreciated India’s approach on introduction of bank-like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for large NBFCs. For supervision of banks, IMF suggested strengthening credit risk management through IFSR 9 adoption and upgrading supervision over individual loans, collateral valuation, connected borrower groups, large exposure limits, and related-party transactions. 6. IMF acknowledges that the regulatory framework in securities markets has been enhanced in line with international practice to manage and prevent emerging risks. Notable improvements include establishing the Corporate Debt Market Development Fund (CDMDF), introducing swing pricing and liquidity requirements for bond mutual funds. The regulatory scope has also been expanded over emerging areas such as sustainability and investor protection measures for fast-growing equity derivatives products. 7. IMF has stated that public digital infrastructures have significantly improved retail financial inclusion and recommended that financially underserved sectors’ access to credit can be enhanced by strengthening legal, tax, and informational infrastructures for asset-based and digital lending. 8. The FSSA report acknowledges that India’s insurance sector is strong and growing, with a significant presence in both life and general insurance. The sector has remained stable, supported by better regulations and digital innovations. The report notes India’s progress in improving oversight, risk management and governance and suggests further steps toward riskbased solvency / supervision frameworks and stronger group supervision. It acknowledged transition plans towards risk-based approach in the insurance sector. This reflects India’s commitment to global best practices and a resilient insurance sector. 9. IMF recommends that financial stability should be the primary objective of the macroprudential authorities. 10. In terms of emerging risks, cybersecurity, climate change and system-wide contagion need attention. Financial stability risks from climate change appear manageable but warrant careful monitoring. The assessment suggested enhanced data coverage with better granularity for mapping climate-related financial risks. 11. IMF also analysed cyber security framework in banking sector, Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI), Critical Information Systems, and other relevant players in securities market. IMF found that Indian authorities have advanced cybersecurity risk oversight, especially for banks. However, IMF stated that extensive cybersecurity crisis simulations and stress tests for banks could be expanded for cross-sectoral and market-wide events to further strengthen cybersecurity resilience. 12. The recommendations in case of India FSAP are mainly focussed on bringing about further improvements in the structure and functioning of the financial system and many of the detailed recommendations are in conformity with the concerned authorities’/regulators’ own developmental plans. India remains committed to adoption of internationally accepted standards and best practices in a phased manner, attuned to domestic needs and economic conditions, wherever necessary.

The Bulletin includes four speeches, five articles and current statistics. The five articles are: ; ; ; ; and . I. State of the Economy The resilience of the global economy is being tested by escalating trade tensions and a heightened wave of uncertainty around the scope, timing, and intensity of tariffs. While engendering heightened volatility in global financial markets, these have also caused apprehensions about the slowdown in global growth. Amidst these challenges, the Indian economy continues to demonstrate resilience as evident in the robust performance of the agriculture sector and improving consumption. The reverberations of a tumultuous external environment, however, are being reflected in sustained foreign portfolio outflows. India’s macroeconomic strength to face these challenges is bolstered by a decline in headline CPI inflation to a seven-month low of 3.6 per cent in February 2025 on account of a further correction in food prices. II. Spatial Distribution of Monsoon and Agricultural Production By Abhinav Narayanan and Harendra Kumar Behera This article analyses the impact of spatial variation of rainfall across districts on production of Kharif crops. It also examines how deficient or excess rainfall during specific periods impact the production of specific crops. Highlights: Extreme weather events such as excessive or insufficient rainfall cause significant crop damages leading to disruptions in production resulting in reduced yields or lower quality of produce.

The timing of extreme weather events is crucial, as crop production cycles vary.

Insufficient rainfall in the months of June and July negatively impacts cereal and pulses production, while oilseeds are particularly vulnerable to excessive rainfall during the harvesting period (August-September). III. Changing Dynamics of India’s Remittances – Insights from the Sixth Round of India’s Remittances Survey By Dhirendra Gajbhiye, Sujata Kundu, Alisha George, Omkar Vinherkar, Yusra Anees, Jithin Baby This article analyses the results of the sixth round of India’s remittances survey conducted for 2023-24. It captures various dimensions of inward remittances to India – country-wise source of remittances, state-wise destination of remittances, transaction-wise size of remittances, prevalent mode of transmission, cost of sending remittances and share of remittances transmitted through the digital modes vis-à-vis cash. Highlights: India’s inward remittances have more than doubled during 2010-11 to 2023-24 and have been a stable source of external financing during this period. Following a pandemic-led contraction during 2020-21, remittances to India in the post pandemic period recorded a significant surge.

The survey results indicate that the share of inward remittances from advanced economies has risen, surpassing the share of Gulf economies in 2023-24, reflecting a shift in migration pattern towards skilled Indian diaspora.

Maharashtra, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, continue to be the dominant recipient of remittances.

The cost of sending remittances to India has moderated significantly, driven by digitalisation, but remains higher than the SDG target of 3 per cent.

Additionally, on an average, 73.5 per cent of total remittances received by the money transfer operators in 2023-24 were through digital mode.

Furthermore, fintech companies offer affordable cross-border remittance services, fostering competition among different remittance service providers. IV. Decoupling Economic Growth from Emissions: A LMDI Decomposition Analysis By Madhuresh Kumar, Shobhit Goel, Manu Sharma, Muskan Garg This article examines the drivers behind India's CO₂ emissions growth from 2012 to 2022 using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. It breaks down total emissions into key contributing factors, including the impact of GDP growth (activity effect), improvements in energy efficiency (energy intensity effect), shifts in the economic structure (structural effect), changes in the composition of fuel (fuel mix effect), and the growing share of renewable energy in electricity generation, which reduces the carbon intensity of electricity (emission factor effect). Highlights: During 2012-22, energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 706 million tons. The main contributor was economic growth (+1073 Mt), with a smaller impact from the change in fuel mix of the economy (+78 Mt). However, gains in energy efficiency (-399 Mt), structural changes (-15 Mt), and improvements in emission intensity of electricity due to increased use of renewables (-30 Mt) helped curb emissions.

India's energy efficiency improved by 1.9 per cent annually, exceeding the global average.

India's growth decoupled from emissions, with a decoupling elasticity of 0.59, comparable to other lower-middle-income countries.

Renewables have had a small but significant impact on emission reduction over the past decade, with solar and wind accounting for 2.1 percent of total primary energy in 2022-23.

Going ahead, the emission factor effect is expected to play a more prominent role as renewables increasingly replace fossil fuels and green hydrogen usage expands in industries. V. Market Access and IMF Arrangements: Evidence from Across the Globe By Shruti Joshi and PSS Vidyasagar The article analyses loans availed by various countries from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during 2000-2023 and finds a negative relation between market access and dependence on IMF’s loan for those countries which resorted to IMF loans. Highlights: During 2000-2023, dependence of Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) on IMF resources increased on account of their limited access to international financial markets and alternate sources of funding. Several fast growing large EMDEs, including India and China, however, did not have to take recourse to the IMF loans.

During the crisis periods, especially the Global Financial Crisis and Euro-Zone Crisis, some Advanced Economies also resorted to IMF loans due to their reduced market access on account of sovereign rating downgrades.

Among countries that resorted to IMF loans, those which faced a larger country risk premium availed larger funding.

Access to alternative sources of funding such as Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) and swap lines reduces the dependence on IMF loans. The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. (Puneet Pancholy)

The MoU was signed by the Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Shri Sanjay Malhotra and the Governor, Bank of Mauritius, Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen G.C.S.K. The MoU documents were exchanged in Port Louis, Mauritius in the presence of the Honourable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the Honourable Prime Minister of Mauritius, Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025. 2. The MoU aims to promote the use of INR and MUR in bilateral trade. The MoU covers all current account transactions and permissible capital account transactions as agreed upon by both the countries. This framework would enable exporters and importers to invoice and pay in their respective domestic currencies, which in turn, would enable the development of a market in the INR-MUR pair. Use of local currencies would optimise costs and settlement time for transactions. 3. This collaboration marks a key milestone in strengthening bilateral cooperation between RBI and BOM. Use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Mauritius as well as deepen financial integration and strengthen the historical, cultural, and economic relations between India and Mauritius.

Shri Sanjay Malhotra, Governor, inaugurated the Conference in the presence of the Deputy Governor, Shri Swaminathan J., Executive Directors of RBI and participants of the conference.

The Governor, in his , highlighted the significant strides in improving banking services over the years. He, however, emphasised the need for significantly enhancing customer experience so as to obviate any need for grievance redressal. He exhorted the Regulated Entities to strengthen their internal grievance redress framework to effectively address grievances at their level and avoid escalation of grievances to the RBI ombudsman. He also highlighted the need for improving the KYC processes and raising customer awareness, specially about digital frauds.

Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, professor, IIT Bombay and Chair of RBI’s Committee on FREE-AI, delivered the keynote address in which he highlighted the role of Large Language Models in developing efficient and scalable systems, especially in the area of customer service and grievance redress. He also underscored the potential risks and challenges in adoption of AI and emphasized the importance of responsible AI.

The Conference also had panel discussions on grievance resolution through technological transformation and adoption of a synergetic approach for strengthening customer protection.

The Reserve Bank has been organising this conference on or around the World Consumer Rights Day, that is, 15th March. World Consumer Rights Day is celebrated every year with the aim of raising global awareness about consumer rights and needs. We organise this conference to reflect on our achievements with regard to consumer services and to deliberate on how to improve services and reduce grievances. We need to improve consumer services, not only because it is our duty to do so, but because it is in our selfish interest to do so. In this age of competition, we would not survive long if we do not provide quality service to our consumers.

2. We have made tremendous strides in improving consumer services over the years. We have enabled internet banking and mobile banking. Most of the banking services, be it opening a deposit account, or taking a small loan have been digitised, adding to the convenience and speed. We are making record number of digital transactions through UPI and other means of digital payments. Many among the younger generation may have never visited a bank branch. We have even enabled opening of accounts using video KYC.

3. While we have enhanced customer experience over the years, the high number of customer grievances continues to be a matter of serious concern. I am told that last year (2023-24), the 95 Scheduled Commercial Banks alone received over 10 million complaints from their customers. If we take into account the complaints received at other RBI-regulated entities (REs), the number would be even higher. One may argue that this amounts to only four complaints per thousand accounts per year as there are about 2.5 billion bank accounts. But, for us, even one complaint is a cause of concern. We have 10 million complaints and with the rapidly growing customer base and expanding suite of products, this may grow, if we do not get our act together.

Customer satisfaction – a cornerstone for banking and other financial services

4. Excellent customer service, in fact excellent customer experience is a sine qua non in any service industry. Our effort should be to enhance the total customer experience. The experience should be such that there is no cause for a grievance that requires a redress. Let me state a fundamental truth: every complaint is a test of trust. When a consumer files a grievance – whether for a disputed transaction, a lapse in service, inappropriate pricing or charges or an unfair practice – it is a signal that our system has fallen short. Left unresolved, such issues can erode consumer confidence and tarnish the entire ecosystem.

5. I am reminded of a real story about customer service. Some of you, especially the management graduates, may have heard it but it is so appropriate for today’s theme that it is worth being retold. In the winter of 1975, in a town in Alaska, a man walked into a store and complained to the salesman present that the snow tyres that he bought some time ago were not holding. The salesman was a little puzzled. He said that he could not replace them but will check what he could do and went to the back of the store. Those of you, who have visited departmental stores in the USA, would know that refunds are processed at the back of the store. The salesman came back after some time and handed over some cash as refund and the customer left satisfied. Can anyone guess why this was unique, as no questions asked policy for refunds is fairly common in the USA? It is because the company in question is Nordstrom which does not even sell tyres. It sells apparel and shoes. But, for Nordstrom, customer comes first. Trusting him and winning his trust is more important than anything else.

6. Some say that this is not a true story. How is this possible? How could a company offer refund for a product which it never sold? Nordstrom, however, insists that this incident did take place. Nordstrom had acquired three stores from another company that sold miscellaneous articles including tyres. The customer did not realise that the store had changed and walked in with his complaint. The key message is that Nordstrom saw itself being in the business of customer service, and not just selling goods. We too need to realise that we are in the business of providing unalloyed customer service and not just selling banking and other financial services.

Top management to accord priority to customer service

7. I am sure you will all agree that we are indeed in the business of customer service. However, I suspect that we are not spending enough time on customer service and grievance redressal as a result of which not only are there a large number of complaints being received by banks and NBFCs but in the absence of satisfactory resolution, a large number of them are getting escalated to RBI Ombudsmen.

8. Let me give you some perspective. The number of complaints received under RBI's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme increased at a compounded average growth rate of almost 50 per cent per year over last two years to 9.34 lakh in 2023-24. The number of complaints processed at the Office of RBI Ombudsman increased by 25 per cent from about 2,35,000 in 2022-23 to almost 2,94,000 in 2023-24. Not only are large number of complaints getting escalated, a large proportion of them – nearly 57 per cent of the maintainable complaints last year – required mediation or formal intervention by the RBI Ombudsmen. You would all agree that this is a highly unsatisfactory situation and needs our urgent attention.

9. I would, therefore, strongly urge all the MD&CEOs, Zonal and Regional Managers and the Branch Managers to spend some time every week, if not every day on grievance redressal. This is a must. All great CEOs find time to do it. We too must keep some time in our diary for improving customer service and grievance redressal.

Improving customer service systems

10. Customer complaints aren’t a nuisance – they are in fact opportunities to improve, innovate, and build trust. Handling them well can define your success. Each unresolved grievance is a missed opportunity for regulated entities to reaffirm customer trust and loyalty. It is also a warning signal as repeat complaints are often signs of systemic flaws. Today, complaints often surface on social media even before reaching official channels, highlighting the need for proactive measures.

11. The effort thus should be to not only resolve the complaints but also to ensure that the same type of complaint does not arise again. Many of the complaints like digital transaction disputes, unauthorized charges, or miscommunication frequently recur. These are clearcut symptoms of underlying issues in the overall customer service framework of the regulated entities. A thorough root cause analysis should be performed for each complaint so as to enable remedial action and avoid repetition of same type of complaint.

12. In fact, I would go a step further. Best service is not one in which there is no occasion for grievance redressal but one in which there is no occasion for the customer service department to step in. Systems should work seamlessly and conveniently so that customers do not have to call the branch or the customer service centre or talk to anyone in the Bank or NBFC. Systems have to be so user-friendly that customers can rely on self-service rather than being dependent on anyone else.

Improving internal grievance redressal systems

13. While improving systems to reduce grievances is important, setting up a robust grievance redressal system is equally important for all regulated entities. I would urge you all to review the same. While the regulations do not make any prescription for the organisational structure for grievance redressal, my experience suggests that there should be at least two levels for grievance redressal in large REs, with unresolved grievances getting escalated from the lower to the higher level. The highest level should be at a fairly high rank. This to ensure that requests do not get rejected without having been examined by a senior functionary who is empowered to take decisions in consumer interest. This will help reduce grievances getting escalated to the Ombudsman. It must also be ensured that there are sufficient number of grievance redress officers at all levels including in the Internal Ombudsman office.

14. I would also like to draw your attention to the misclassification of complaints as requests, queries, and disputes by the regulated entities. This results in the complainants’ grievances remaining unaddressed. Moreover, this is also a gross regulatory violation.

Major areas of service improvement

15. Let me now briefly allude to some of the major areas where we need to improve. These relate to KYC, digital frauds, mis-selling, and aggressive recovery practices.

16. As for KYC, we need to ensure that once a customer has submitted documents to a financial institution, we do not insist on obtaining the same documents again. Once the customer has updated his details, for example, his residential address, with one regulated entity of any financial sector regulator, it gets updated in CKYCR and other REs are notified of the updation. PML Rules made by the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance and RBI’s Master Directions on KYC mandate regulated entities to check the CKYCR system before seeking KYC documents for opening an account. However, most banks and NBFCs have not enabled the same in their branches/business outlets, causing avoidable inconvenience to customers. This may be facilitated early. This will be in the interest of all.

17. Another important issue connected to customer protection is rising digital frauds. It is a matter of great concern that innocent customers continue to fall prey to scamsters. While this could be attributed to rise in digital transactions and innovative methods adopted by fraudsters, lack of customer awareness is also a major reason for the same. To mitigate this menace, REs not only need to put in place robust internal controls but also enhance digital financial literacy.

18. The issues of mis-selling and aggressive recovery practices have been highlighted earlier too. In this context too, I would request you to keep consumer interest supreme.

Embracing technology – the AI way

19. Let me now come to the theme of this year’s conference: AI’s potential to revolutionize grievance redressal. We are entering an exciting era where technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), can drive remarkable improvements in speed, accuracy, and fairness of complaint resolution.

20. AI can help categorize incoming complaints by urgency, complexity, or subject area, ensuring minimal delay in reaching the right people or the right team. AI can also help in optimising complaint routing. Further, it can assist in decision-making and reducing processing time.

21. Secondly, AI can be used to pinpoint systemic gaps by analysing both structured and unstructured data such as emails, chat logs, and call transcripts. This will aid in identifying training needs and guiding necessary process reforms. Using data from millions of consumer branch visits, call centre logs, mobile apps, and social media, a unified, AI-driven view of all these interactions can help identify common pain points more efficiently. Leveraging data analytics, sentiment analysis, and predictive models, AI can be used to analyse large volumes of data to detect spikes in issues – such as ATM failures or erroneous charges – and alert REs pre-emptively.

22. Lastly, in a linguistically diverse country like India, AI-driven chatbots and voice recognition tools can eliminate language barriers by operating in local languages. Moreover, the implementation of conversational AI in chatbots, voicebots, and advanced IVR systems can handle routine queries round the clock, thereby freeing people to focus on cases that require empathy and complex problem-solving.

23. In short, integrating AI at every stage – from complaint lodging to closure – can result in a seamless, efficient, and data-driven grievance redressal system. Such a framework not only reduces processing times and addresses repetitive complaints but also fosters equitable outcomes by mitigating human biases. It is time that the banking industry explores and pioneers the integration of technology – including AI – to strengthen the grievance resolution mechanisms and make it best in class across the globe.

Challenges and guardrails in AI driven grievance redressal system

24. While AI presents unparalleled opportunities, we need to be cognizant of the challenges and risks that its adoption poses. There are concerns on data privacy, algorithmic bias and complexity in AI-driven models. As we embrace AI in grievance redressal or any other process, we must also remain mindful of ethical considerations. Human oversight, bias mitigation and data privacy must be integrated into the AI Systems to ensure transparent and consistent outcomes.

Investing in human resources

25. While technology in all its forms is a powerful enabler, I would like to emphasise that it is no substitute for integrity, empathy, and human judgment. In a world increasingly driven by data, algorithms, and automation, it is all too easy to lose sight of the human element. Every transaction represents not just a number in a ledger, but the hard-earned savings of a family, the dreams of a small entrepreneur, or the lifelong savings of a senior citizen. It is, therefore, critical that REs continue to invest in human resources dedicated for customer service and grievance redressal. It is essential to invest in training of staff, especially in behavioural aspects of customer service. Moreover, the staff needs to be empowered to take decisions based on their judgement to redress consumer grievances, enhance customer satisfaction and win consumer trust.

RBI as a facilitator

26. In the end, I would like to assure you that, while we exhort you to provide services efficiently to customers, we in the Reserve Bank shall also provide various services, approvals, clarifications, etc. to the regulated entities in a timely manner. We already have a citizen’s charter. We are in the process of reviewing the charter. We will make the charter comprehensive to include all services that we offer either to the REs or directly to citizens. Moreover, we are reviewing the timelines for each service. It will be our endeavour to provide all approvals, etc. within the timelines. We are also making mandatory the use of PRAVAAH, which is RBI’s secure and centralised web-based portal for any individual or entity to seek authorisation, license or regulatory approval on any reference made to the Reserve Bank in a timely manner. This will help us in expediting the disposal of applications received by the Reserve Bank.

Conclusion

27. We stand at a pivotal juncture as India looks to realise its dream of a more resilient and inclusive Viksit Bharat. With the financial sector touching the lives of almost the entire population, we have a critical role. To succeed in this role, we must continue to enhance customer service and customer protection.

I would not dwell in detail about the perils of climate change since this audience is already well aware about its impact not only on the real economy, but also the financial system, as well as our day-to-day lives. Climate related changes are perceptible, clear, and visible. They are intensifying and threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and economies. It is our individual and collective responsibility, to work together effectively and contribute to the global efforts to mitigate the risks associated with climate change and ensure that the Indian financial system remains resilient. Dimensions of Climate Change Risks 2. There are two dimensions to climate change related risks that we as regulators, policymakers and practitioners have to be aware of – the first is facilitative involving capacity building, development of the ecosystem and financing of green and sustainable transition; and the second is the prudential aspect, which is related to risk management. 3. While the role of the Central Banks in managing risks posed by climate change to the financial system is increasingly being recognised, their role in facilitating the financing of green and sustainable transition has been a matter of debate and has varying dimensions to it. Central Banks in Advanced Economies have traditionally followed an asset neutral approach. Central Banks in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), on the other hand, have adopted directed lending policies to channelise credit to certain sectors of their economies given their individual country circumstances and developmental objectives. In the Indian context, as you are all aware, the priority sector lending guidelines facilitate credit to be channelled to specific sectors including renewable energy. 4. On the prudential aspect, there are several channels through which climate change risks impact the financial system. All the major types of financial risks - be it credit, market, or operational risk - are influenced by climate change. These risks include losses from credit portfolio due to extreme climate events or natural disasters (physical risks) and loss in value of collaterals due to stranded assets (transition risks); losses from investments; and operational losses. Although climate change impacts almost all economic sectors, the extent and nature of these risks vary by sector, industry, geography, and institution. The mitigation of climate change risks, therefore, rests – firstly, on realistic and comprehensive assessment of the frequency and severity of climate risks and secondly, estimating their financial impact, which is no easy task. 5. As a Central Bank, the Reserve Bank is mindful of its role in addressing and mitigating risks to the financial system from climate change. In this context, our endeavour has been to play the role of a facilitator – including supporting capacity building and fostering a conducive regulatory framework for promoting green and sustainable finance. One important aspect of green financing/lending for sustainable finance is the higher credit risk due to borrowers’ use of new and emerging green technologies, which have relatively limited track record in terms of reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Regulated Entities, therefore, need to develop suitable capacity and technical know-how to better appraise risks in financing projects which use such green technologies. Evolution of climate change risks and mitigation for the Indian Financial System. 6. The Reserve Bank’s approach with respect to climate related financial risks is oriented not just for the short-term but also the medium-term, taking into consideration the evolving national and global circumstances. Over the short-term, our goal is to be able to make a realistic estimation of the impact of climate related risks not just on individual institutions but also on the financial system as a whole. This would involve scenario analysis and stress testing exercises, using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. 7. The risk management framework in Regulated Entities for climate related financial risks is still evolving. There is a need for concerted efforts in developing the risk management framework; building technical expertise and competencies for comprehensive assessment and mitigation of climate related financial risks as also on the extent of losses due to such risks. I would now like to highlight some of the initiatives of the Reserve Bank has taken in this regard. 8. Climate related financial risk modelling is very important and data intensive. There is limited data available for measuring financial impact of climate change. Moreover, there is lack of benchmark sectoral transition pathways and country-specific carbon emission database. These constraints limit our ability to make a comprehensive assessment of climate change risks. These limitations also constrain comparison of financial impact, as each Regulated Entity may use its own assumptions and models to process climate related data. To address such constraints, we had in October last year announced the creation of a repository called the Reserve Bank – Climate Risk Information System (RB-CRIS). The repository is intended to bridge data gaps by providing standardised datasets. These datasets include hazard data, vulnerability data and exposure data related to physical risk assessment, sectoral transition pathways and carbon emission intensity database related to transition risk assessment. Work on this repository is underway and we expect to launch it later this year. 9. Several jurisdictions have started work on the assessment and disclosure of climate related risks. International organisations such as International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation has released standards on climate related disclosures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has also released a consultative document on disclosure of climate-related financial risks with a view to integrate climate risk related disclosures under the Pillar III disclosure requirements of the Basel framework. The Reserve Bank, as you are aware, had already issued draft guidelines on Disclosure Framework on Climate related Financial risks in February 2024, for public comments. We have received valuable feedback and are in the process of finalising the guidelines. A guidance note on Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing is also being developed for the Regulated Entities. 10. As we all are aware, technology and finance have a critical role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. There is a need to build innovative solutions and capabilities in these areas. The Reserve Bank has been encouraging and facilitating innovations through its Regulatory Sandbox and Hackathon initiatives in the Fintech space. We propose to set up a dedicated “on Tap” cohort on climate change risks and sustainable finance under RBI’s Regulatory Sandbox initiative. We are also planning to conduct a special “Greenathon” on climate change and related aspects. 11. We had in April 2023, issued the Framework on acceptance of Green Deposits with the objective of enabling banks to augment the flow of credit to green activities and projects. This again shows our willingness to facilitate financing green/sustainable projects. The idea behind the Green Deposits is similar to that of sovereign green bonds. We all need to raise awareness about such products. 12. I would like to highlight an important initiative to promote green finance. We have included finance to small renewable energy projects – solar, biomass based, windmills, micro-hydel plants and non-conventional energy based public utilities viz. street lighting systems, and remote village electrification projects as part of priority sector lending. 13. One of the oft-cited constraints to adequate flow of climate related finance has been the lack of bankable projects. Capacity and expertise constraints limit the ability to appraise and thus finance climate change mitigation. It also enhances the risk of funding such projects. Thus, creation of a common pool of such bankable projects will have multi-fold benefits for the entire ecosystem. Regulated Entities with experience of such projects can contribute to the pool for the benefit of others, while also benefiting from such information shared by other Regulated Entities. This will help share knowledge for benefit of all. There is a need for collaboration in this emerging and evolving area. I urge the Regulated Entities to seriously consider setting up such a pool through an appropriate institutional arrangement. 14. Before I conclude, let me say what is perhaps obvious. The impact of climate change risks is not limited to the financial system alone but extends to the real economy. Be it the corporates or the MSMEs or the agricultural sector, climate change risks are ubiquitous. This calls for a cohesive co-ordination and harmonisation in approach, among not only the financial sector regulators and the Regulated Entities but also various government agencies. There is a need to adopt a holistic approach towards mitigation of climate change risks considering the country specific requirements and circumstances. We will collaborate and coordinate with the government and other regulators to ensure that there is harmonisation and consistency in rules, regulations and our approach towards mitigating the impacts of climate change. 15. I am happy to note that while we are deliberating on this important topic, the Annual Steering Committee meeting of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is also taking place today at this venue. NGFS is doing some pioneering work in the area of managing climate related financial risks. Be it the NGFS scenarios, the recent work on adaptation, or the work on data directory, they have been a source of technical guidance and capacity building across the globe. We look forward to continued engagement and coordination with the NGFS. Conclusion 16. To conclude, let me reiterate that climate change risks are real and all stakeholders need to be prepared to address the risks and challenges from climate change. Even though we have made a decent start, there are still issues that need to be addressed. The Reserve Bank remains committed to continue adopting a constructive and consultative approach towards supporting the various initiatives being undertaken towards management and mitigation of financial risks related to climate change. We will continue to work steadfastly to realise our vision to build a financial system that can not only withstand future climate shocks, but also actively contribute to India’s journey towards a sustainable and resilient future. I urge you all to contribute towards this cause. As Albert Einstein had said “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.” Let me also take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to you and your families on the occasion of Holi - the festival of colours.

Investing is an important tool for individuals and families in achieving their financial goals, such as affording higher education, supporting retirement, or simply building wealth for the future. While building for their own financial future, investors are also playing a key role in powering the innovation-based U.S. economy by providing capital to businesses of all sizes.

“Financial Literacy Month provides an excellent opportunity to highlight the importance of investors saving and investing for their financial future. From stocks, bonds, and funds to newer products in the marketplace, investing ultimately supports our nation’s overall economy,” said Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. “All investors have an opportunity to reach their personal financial goals while also playing a role in capital formation, which makes our economy so dynamic.”

During the month of April, SEC regional and headquarters staff will encourage investors to take advantage of the free saving and investing tools and resources available on Investor.gov. OIEA’s “Ten Investment Tips for 2025 Investor Bulletin” provides investors with information on how to avoid investment scams, the importance of diversification, how to be an informed investor, and more. Investors can also test their investing knowledge by taking April’s Financial Literacy Month Quiz.

As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in August 2020 and June 2021, Randy Miller’s nonprofit company, Legacy Cares, issued approximately $284 million in municipal bonds through an Arizona state entity to finance the construction of a multi-sports park and family entertainment center in Mesa, Arizona. Investors were to be paid from revenue from the sports complex, and investors were given financial projections for revenue that were multiple times the amount needed to cover payments to investors, according to the complaint. However, the complaint alleges that the defendants fabricated or altered documents forming the basis for those revenue projections, including letters of intent and contracts with sports clubs, leagues, and other entities to use the sports complex. The sports complex opened in January 2022 with far fewer events and much lower attendance and generated tens of millions less in revenue than expected under the false projections, and the bonds defaulted in October 2022, according to the complaint.

“As our complaint alleges, these defendants used fake documents to deceive municipal bond investors into believing a sports complex would generate more than enough revenue to make payments to bondholders,” said Antonia Apps, Acting Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. “Maintaining the integrity of the approximately $4 trillion municipal bond market is critical for local governments and investors alike. The SEC will hold accountable individuals who defraud municipal bond investors.”

The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Randy Miller, Chad Miller, and De Laveaga with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges for similar conduct.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by William T. Salzmann, Jonathan Grant, Joseph Chimienti, and Creighton Papier and supervised by David Zhou and Rebecca Olsen of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. They were assisted by Steven Varholik of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jason Bussey of the San Francisco Regional Office, Mr. Salzmann, and Mr. Grant.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges against David Yow Shang Chiueh of East Hanover, New Jersey and his investment advisory firm, Upright Financial Corp., for misconduct and for investing more than 25 percent of Upright Growth Fund’s assets in a single company over multiple years, causing losses of $1.6 million.

In November 2021, Chiueh and Upright settled SEC charges that they, as investment advisers to Upright Growth Fund, violated its policy by investing more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry between July 2017 and June 2020, committing fraud and breaching their fiduciary duties. Despite being ordered to stop this conduct, the SEC’s complaint alleges, the defendants continued their fraud by violating the 25 percent industry concentration limit and making misrepresentations about it between at least November 24, 2021, and June 23, 2024. As a result, the complaint alleges that the defendants’ decision to wait more than two-and-a-half years to sell the relevant stock resulted in losses of approximately $1.6 million to the fund and its investors.

Additionally, the SEC’s complaint alleges the defendants engaged in further misconduct during this same period when Chiueh operated the fund’s board without the required number of independent trustees and misrepresented the independence of one in filings. The defendants also failed to provide or withheld key information from the board, according to the complaint, and they hired an accountant for the fund without the required vote by the board.

“As alleged, the defendants not only ran the fund contrary to its fundamental investment policies, but they actively misled investors and the fund’s board about their conduct,” said Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit. “Undeterred by their prior SEC settlement involving these very same issues, we allege that the defendants repeatedly violated fundamental rules designed to protect investors in mutual funds.”

The SEC’s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, including provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Stephen Holden and Ming Ming Yang, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Mr. Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit, as well as Debra Jaroslawicz, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office.

Boomer, and its former chief operating officer and partner Tiffany L. Hawkins, for breaches by Boomer and Hawkins of their fiduciary duties when they misused fund and portfolio company assets.

According to the SEC’s orders, from at least August 2021 through February 2024, Hawkins misappropriated approximately $223,000 from portfolio companies of a private fund she managed with Boomer and that was advised by Momentum Advisors. Specifically, Hawkins misused portfolio company debit cards in more than 100 transactions to pay for vacations, clothing, and other personal expenses, and caused herself to be paid compensation in excess of her authorized salary. As set forth in the orders, Hawkins concealed her misconduct from Momentum Advisors, from the portfolio companies’ bookkeeper, and from SEC staff, and Boomer failed to reasonably supervise Hawkins despite red flags of her misappropriation. The order against Boomer also finds that he caused the fund to pay a business debt that should have been paid by an entity he and Hawkins controlled, resulting in an unearned benefit to the entity of $346,904, and that Momentum Advisors failed to adopt and implement adequate policies and procedures and to have the fund audited as required.

“As the orders find, Hawkins and Boomer breached their fiduciary duties and misused fund and portfolio company assets for their own benefit, all to the detriment of their clients,” said Thomas P. Smith, Jr., Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office.

The orders find that Hawkins and Boomer violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that Momentum Advisors violated the compliance and custody rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Hawkins, Boomer, and Momentum Advisors consented to the entry of cease-and-desist orders. Additionally, Hawkins agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty and to be subject to an associational bar; Boomer agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be subject to a 12-month supervisory suspension; and Momentum Advisors agreed to a censure and to pay a $235,000 civil penalty.

As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in late 2021, Butkus, under the alias Darius Karpavicius, operated fictitious investment firms TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group and offered investors shares in sham mutual funds through the firms’ websites, a press release, and internet advertisements, all of which made numerous materially false and misleading statements. According to the complaint, these websites and other materials falsely stated, among other things, that the TBO Capital and Gray Capital mutual funds were managed by industry professionals with decades of experience and achieved years of high-yield investment returns. In reality, the complaint alleges, the managers did not exist, their biographies were fake, and TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group never made any investments. Rather, as alleged, the entire operation was a fraud run by Butkus to enrich himself. Butkus allegedly used some of the investors' money to operate his fraudulent scheme, but stole most for his personal benefit, such as dining at restaurants, cash withdrawals, and crypto asset purchases.

“Butkus’ conduct was egregious: He went to great lengths to defraud unsuspecting investors using sophisticated websites, internet advertisements, and an alias complete with a doctored passport,” said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “This case underscores the SEC’s unwavering commitment to hold individuals accountable for engaging in fraud that harms retail investors.”

The SEC is refiling this action, which it voluntarily dismissed on January 11, 2024, against Butkus’s alias, “Darius Karpavicius,” through a dismissal without prejudice.

The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Butkus, HMC Trading LLC, and HMC Management LLC with violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and names another Butkus-controlled entity, DK Auto LLC, as a relief defendant. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants. It also seeks disgorgement with interest from the relief defendant.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Vaughn, Katherine H. Stella, and Andrea Fox with assistance from the Division of Enforcement’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. It was supervised by Peter Rosario, George Bagnall, and Stacy L. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Peter Lallas and supervised by James Connor. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations’ New York Field Office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:12:52.577756

The SEC’s complaint alleges that, between 2018 and 2023, Burak engaged in a fraudulent scheme to recruit investors in his so-called investment fund, Never Alone Capital LLC, by falsely representing himself as a wealthy hedge fund owner, telling investors that Never Alone was an investment fund, and claiming that investor money would be invested in “Wall Street” pursuant to a complex investment strategy, in some cases with a guaranteed return. Burak allegedly raised approximately $4 million from at least 17 investors, several of whom he met through a company that provides financial education programs in Spanish to the Latino community. However, as alleged in the complaint, Burak did not invest the money as he represented that he would. In fact, as alleged, Burak misappropriated the bulk of investor deposits, including to pay credit card charges for, among other things, luxury skin care and payments to an adult-only subscription service. Burak also allegedly sent investors false account statements that generally showed consistently positive returns, when in fact investors were consistently losing money. Burak eventually stopped responding to investors and, in an audio recording from July 2022, he stated, among other things, that he was fake, he did not have a real business, and he was stealing money from people.

“As our complaint alleges, Burak convinced investors to trust him by lying about his investment expertise and strategies and then stole their money,” said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “We remain committed to identifying and holding accountable those who prey on innocent investors, and encourage those who suspect they are victims of fraud to report it to the SEC.”

The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Burak with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, as well as conduct-based injunctions.

In a parallel action, the New York County District Attorney’s Office today filed criminal charges against Burak.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Bari R. Nadworny, Thomas Feretic, and Lindsay S. Moilanen under the supervision of Tejal D. Shah of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Sushila Rao Pentapati and Ms. Nadworny under the supervision of Preethi Krishnamurthy.

Under the rule, a covered clearing agency that provides central counterparty services for U.S. Treasury securities must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to requir","The Securities and Exchange Commission today extended the compliance dates for Rule 17ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(A) and (B) under the Securities Exchange Act by one year to Dec. 31, 2026, for eligible cash market transactions, and June 30, 2027, for eligible repo market transactions. Under the rule, a covered clearing agency that provides central counterparty services for U.S. Treasury securities must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require that every direct participant of the covered clearing agency submit for clearance and settlement all eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to which it is a counterparty. The rule also requires a covered clearing agency to identify and monitor its direct participants’ submissions of transactions for clearing, including how the covered clearing agency would address a failure to submit transactions.

The Commission also issued a temporary exemption regarding Exchange Act Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i). This rule requires that covered clearing agencies have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate, collect, and hold margin amounts from a direct participant for its proprietary positions in U.S. Treasury securities separately and independently from margin calculated and collected from that direct participant in connection with U.S. Treasury securities transactions by an indirect participant that relies on the services provided by the direct participant to access the U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities. Under this temporary exemption, a U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency is not required to enforce its written policies and procedures regarding Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) until Sept. 30, 2025, instead of the original March 31, 2025, compliance date.

“The U.S. Treasury market is a critical piece of the global financial system. New rules must be implemented properly, and any operational issues must be addressed,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. “This one-year extension provides additional time to implement and validate operational changes. Direct participants will also have more time to implement important risk management changes to comply with U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency rules. The Commission stands ready to engage with market participants on issues associated with implementation.”

The extension will provide additional time for further engagement on compliance, operational, and interpretive questions, and facilitate an orderly implementation of the rules. The temporary exemption allows covered clearing agencies not to enforce policies and procedures established pursuant to Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) against any market participants currently clearing indirect participant activity that are not ready to comply with such policies and procedures, but it does not affect the ability of a covered clearing agency to implement such policies and procedures for those that are prepared to comply. If a direct participant of a U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency determines to offer certain access models or segregated margin accounts, the covered clearing agency would be obligated to enforce those rules regarding such models or accounts against the relevant participant, and the direct participant must comply with those rules.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:12:55.125483

According to the SEC’s order, from approximately June 2020 through October 2023, One Oak and DeRosa recommended that DeRosa’s customers at an unaffiliated broker-dealer, at which he was simultaneously employed, convert more than 180 brokerage accounts to advisory accounts at One Oak. Most of these customers were elderly and had been long-time customers of DeRosa’s at the broker-dealer, which charged the customers on a commission basis. According to the order, One Oak and DeRosa ignored their fiduciary duty and failed to adequately disclose that the conversions from brokerage accounts to advisory accounts would result in significantly higher fees for the clients and increased compensation for DeRosa; nor did they disclose the resulting conflict of interest. The order finds that the change in fee structure resulted in significantly increased costs, but the clients generally received no additional services or benefits. The order further finds that One Oak and DeRosa failed to adequately consider whether it was in their clients’ best interests to convert their brokerage accounts to advisory accounts, and in fact, many of the accounts were not suitable to be advisory accounts.

“We remain committed to holding accountable investment advisers who breach their fiduciary duties at the expense of retail clients,” said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. “One Oak and DeRosa converted brokerage accounts to advisory accounts when it benefitted them through higher fees, but that conversion was not in their clients’ best interests.”

The SEC’s order finds that One Oak and DeRosa willfully violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that One Oak also violated the compliance rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, One Oak consented to an order requiring it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review certain of its policies and procedures related to its retail business. Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, DeRosa agreed to a civil penalty of $75,000 and to a nine-month industry suspension.

Bad actors have become increasingly sophisticated and, in the event of a breach, may be able to use the names, addresses, and years of birth to impersonate a customer or broker-dealer and gain access to a customer’s account. Providing an exemption from the requirement to report this PII to the CAT will help mitigate potential security risks.

“Over 12 years ago, the CAT was designed with the goal of creating a modernized audit trail system to enable regulators to analyze and reconstruct market events,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. “Today’s exemptive order eliminates the requirement to report names, addresses, and years of birth for any U.S. natural person who trades in the stock market and recognizes that such information is not necessary to achieve CAT’s objectives. Despite today’s action, bad actors and other miscreants who engage in insider trading, market manipulation, and other schemes should be forewarned that the Commission has more than sufficient investigative tools to hold them accountable.”

Names, addresses, and years of birth were originally required to be collected in the CAT to facilitate the generation of unique anonymized customer IDs and to help regulators identify the person(s) responsible for a trade. In 2020, the Commission issued an order exempting the reporting of some of the most sensitive PII, including social security numbers. Today, the Commission issued an order exempting additional PII from the CAT.

Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.

“It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. “This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.”

This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.

Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.

Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities.

Additionally, the Commission publishes on its website failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.","Financial Regulations, Investment","Investors, US Economy",USA,,False,2025-04-03T16:13:00.758185
