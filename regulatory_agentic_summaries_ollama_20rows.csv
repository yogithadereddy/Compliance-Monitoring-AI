We shall remain vigilant, adaptive, and forward-looking. We will continue to collaborate effectively with all stakeholders ‚Äì governments and financial sector regulators, among others. We will do everything that is required to improve the financial system by expanding its access, enhancing its efficiency, and strengthening its resilience in an evolving economic landscape. 9. Even as we embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches, our core values - integrity, transparency, and commitment to public service - will continue to guide us. The trust that the people of India repose in the Reserve Bank is our greatest asset. We are determined to preserve it and further strengthen it in the years ahead.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in . Government transactions eligible for agency commission 2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI: Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Governments Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments and Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for agency commission 3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India. Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur. 4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business. Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt. 5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e-mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work. 6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above. Government transactions not eligible for agency commission 7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission. 8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission. Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc. through agency banks by government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers. The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies/Municipalities/ companies/ Corporations/Local Bodies. Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies etc. Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government Ministry/Department (in consultation with CGA) or a State Government Department through any bank. Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on the mandate received from the governments. Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or State Government as ineligible for agency commission. 9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI from time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission and submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while claiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions. 10. Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI: After the operationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X7, agency banks authorised to collect Goods and Service Tax (GST), Customs and Central Excise Duties through ICEGATE, Direct Taxes under TIN 2.0 channel shall upload their luggage files in RBI‚Äôs QPX/e-Kuber on all days except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, all non-working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RBI for Government Transactions due to exigencies. It is to be ensured that these luggage files are uploaded in RBI‚Äôs QPX/e-Kuber on or before 1800 hours prescribed by Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs and Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Direct Taxes. No extension in cut-off time will be allowed to agency banks by RBI beyond 1800 hours for uploading of these luggage files in QPX/e-Kuber. 11. The date of monthly balance transfer for the State Government transactions is 5th of the following month. The State Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of previous month reported after 4th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned State government. 12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) or any adjustments thereof, if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of transaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned Ministry/Department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement. Rates for agency commission 13. As per agency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under: Sr. No. Type of Transaction Unit Revised Rate a. (i) Receipts - Physical mode Per transaction ‚Çπ40/- (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction ‚Çπ9/- b. Pension Payments Per transaction ‚Çπ75/- c. Payments other than Pension Per ‚Çπ100 turnover 6.5 paise per ‚Çπ100 14. In this context, the ‚ÄòReceipts-e-mode transactions‚Äô indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter‚Äôs bank account through Internet banking as well as such transactions which do not involve physical receipt of cash /instruments at all. For example, challan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode. 15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017. 16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited. Therefore, records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission. 17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension transactions at the rate of ‚Çπ75 per transaction only when the entire work relating to disbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them. If the work relating to pension calculations etc. is attended to by the concerned Government Department / Treasury and the banks are required only to credit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under ‚Äòother than pension payment‚Äô and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 paise per ‚Çπ100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019. 18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should not exceed 14 per pensioner per year. This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits. 19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages. Where, however, the work is shared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the proportion of 75:25. Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency banks as detailed below: At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e., up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the Pay and Accounts Offices, and treasuries/sub-treasuries. At 75% of the applicable rate, where the dealing branch is required to account for the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank conducting government business. At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the scrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible for the accounting of these transactions and dispatching of the scrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc. 20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in certain cases. So also, for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of State government/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/Treasury. This new arrangement for settlement of State government funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018. Claiming agency commission 21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format (with GST details) to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State Government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt and transactions related to direct tax collection under TIN 2.0 regime, and transactions pertaining to collection of indirect taxes through ICEGATE reported to Mumbai Regional Office, RBI will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all authorized agency banks are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to the respective receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The agency commission claim for Central Government transactions reported to CAS, Nagpur, RBI will be continued to be settled at CAS, Nagpur, RBI. The formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in , and respectively. These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof. 22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, claims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank‚Äôs internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit. 23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated November 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, centrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been replaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be. 24. For eligible Government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter. 25. However, for eligible Government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto. 26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate. Agency banks may also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate. Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims. 27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to Reserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions have been conducted. If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above, they may forward the same to RBI, only after giving reasons for delay. Penal interest for wrong claims 28. As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-compliance of instructions issued by Government or Reserve Bank shall attract imposition of penalty. Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.

In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also requested to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgements in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. 5. Is it possible to submit life certificates without visiting the branch? Yes, pensioners can submit life certificates without visiting the branch using Jeevan Praman provided the Pension Sanctioning Authority is on boarded on the platform.

The pension paying agency banks have to revise the Dearness Relief based on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing the information from the website of the concerned governments, and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. 8.

Chief General Manager Encl.: As above Master Circular ‚Äì Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks Introduction Payment of pension to retired government employees, including payment of basic pension, increased dearness relief (DR), and other benefits, as and when announced by the governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by concerned Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till March 31, 2025 ( ). It does not replace or supersede any existing government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the past will continue to remain in operation subject to changes being made by the competent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarized hereunder. General Instructions Government orders on DR, etc. on websites 2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the procedure of forwarding related government orders in respect of dearness relief etc. to pension disbursing agency banks has been discontinued. Agency banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing from the government websites and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately. Prompt implementation of Government‚Äôs instructions by agency banks 3. All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines/ instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI. Timing of pension disbursement by agency banks 4. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities. Refund of excess pension payment to Government 5. Whenever any excess/overpayment is detected, the entire amount thereof should be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately, when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is independent of recovery from the pensioner. Agency banks are requested to seek guidance from respective Pension Sanctioning Authorities regarding the process to be followed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any. 6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority‚Äôs acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank‚Äôs record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India. Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners 7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorize such pensioners as under: Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect /incapacity. 8. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under: Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account. 9. The pensioner may also be asked to indicate to the bank as to who would withdraw the pension amount from the bank on the basis of cheque/ withdrawal form as obtained above and that person should be identified by two independent witnesses. The person who would be actually drawing the money from the bank should be asked to furnish his signature to the bank. 10. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled pensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to strictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and sensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to the on pension disbursement hosted on our website ( ) in case of any doubt. Reimbursement of pension payments 11. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at Regional Office for Central / State Government pension payments respectively. Continuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner 12. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in case the spouse (family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO). Life Certificate- Issuance of Acknowledgement 13. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgments in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners. Single Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments 14. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of reimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each pension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims. Customer Service 15. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum include the items given in . Agency banks may also instruct their internal auditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which may be made available to Reserve Bank‚Äôs inspecting officers, as and when they visit the branches. 16. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level, especially, after the setting up of Centralized Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular interaction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint one/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at monthly intervals. 17. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress complaints. 18. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing revised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised as under: Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment and the compensation shall be credited to the pensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in respect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008. Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain immediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authorities directly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the Reserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the Governments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself. When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feels disenfranchised. All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in all their dealings with the bank. Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details about pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners through the net or at the branches at periodic intervals, as may be deemed necessary and sufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements. All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payments must be accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business that there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular pension/arrears thereof. All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners who are of old age. Annex 1 Checklist relating to Government Business (pension related) for internal / concurrent audit Internal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner customers. In this regard, the following may be ensured: 1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for use during inspection of pension paying branches. 2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and enquire about their satisfaction with pension-related services. 3. A detailed checklist relating to pension payments/government business may be given by banks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of India, relating to pension payments/government business. These include the following: Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in dearness relief etc. Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of pensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of pensioners of all governments and departments exceeds affixed number, say, 100 or 200. Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts and the status is being indicated on the monthly pension slips issued to the pensioners. Whether pension accounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever applicable. Whether the bank branch has an effective complaint redressal mechanism, and the complaints of pensioners are attended promptly, and their grievances redressed expeditiously. Whether the pension is credited to pensioner‚Äôs account during the last four working days of the month except for the month of March for which pension is to be credited on or after first working day of April. Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Certificate/ Non-employment certificate/Employment Certificate from the pensioners in the month of November every year. Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension payments wherever applicable. Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably given by the tax collecting branches. Whether the challans are stamped giving bank‚Äôs BSR code and Challan Identification Number (CIN) clearly. Whether the stamped challans are kept in the custody of bank‚Äôs staff and handed over to the concerned taxpayer only on production of the paper token.

The decline in Indian residents‚Äô foreign assets during October-December 2024 was mainly on account of the decrease of US$ 70.1 billion in reserve assets.

Reserve assets, however, recorded an increase of US$ 13.2 billion over December 2023.

The fall in India‚Äôs foreign liabilities was due to the decline in inward direct and portfolio investments during the quarter, though trade credit, loans and currency & deposits recorded an increase.

Reserve assets accounted for 59.0 per cent of India‚Äôs total international financial assets in December 2024 ( ).

Variation in the exchange rate of rupee vis-a-vis other currencies impacted the change in liabilities, when valued in the US dollar terms.

The ratio of India‚Äôs international assets to international liabilities improved to 74.7 per cent in December 2024 from 73.1 per cent a year ago.

The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased to 53.6 per cent in December 2024 from 52.9 per cent a quarter ago and 51.2 per cent a year ago ( ). (Puneet Pancholy)

1. Current Account: The balance of trade for goods was negative at -$71.6 million and services was positive at $45.0 million, resulting in an overall deficit of $10.4 million in 2019. In 2020, the balance of trade for goods worsened to -$79.2 million, while services improved to $51.2 million, resulting in a larger deficit of $11.5 million. The deficits in both years were smaller than the balance of trade for 2018 (which was -$30.6 million).

2. Primary Income: This category refers to income from international investments and includes interest, rent, royalties, and labor income. In 2019, there was a deficit of $13.1 million, which increased to $16.7 million in 2020.

3. Secondary Income: This category refers to income from transfers such as pensions, remittances, and worker's compensation. In 2019, there was a surplus of $29.3 million, which decreased to $2.9 million in 2020.

4. Capital Account and Financial Account: These categories represent foreign investment in the country and domestic investment abroad. The total investment inflow increased from $11.3 billion in 2019 to $10.9 billion in 2020. This was due to a decrease in direct investment ($2.8 million less in 2020) but an increase in portfolio investments ($9.4 million more in 2020). Other investments, such as NRI deposits and ECBs to India, also increased slightly from $32.2 billion in 2019 to $33.1 billion in 2020.

5. Reserve Assets: The country's foreign exchange reserves decreased by $6.0 billion from 2019 to 2020.

6. Errors & Omissions: This category represents any discrepancies between the Current Account and the Capital/Financial Account, which were negligible in both years (less than $0.6 million).

Overall, the data shows a slight worsening of the trade balance for goods and services in 2020 compared to 2019, but an increase in foreign investment inflows, particularly from portfolio investments. The decrease in reserve assets suggests that the country may have used some of its reserves to address economic challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic."
